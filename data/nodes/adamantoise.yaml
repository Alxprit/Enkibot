    previous-nodes: ['w1_after_flight', 'crayclaw']
  Generic:
    - "The Adamantoise has 2000 HP, good magic evade, and sky-high physical defenses."
    - "Has powerful physical attacks, which you'll want to scam with back-row + mitigation/status aliments."
    - "The hard part is simply managing to get damge on this guy."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Unless you can just snap a Frost Rod on him hahaha what's class balance?"
  Generic`:
    - "Any source of Ice damage will bypass his defenses."
  Ranger:
    - "Like, say, a Ranger with a Ice Bow you can buy in Crescent Town."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can one-shot him instantly with Level 5 Death from your Blue Mage."
  Beastmaster:
    - "He's not Heavy, so a Banish from a !released Bandersnatch (near Walse) will have a 50/50 chance of killing him."
  Berserker:
    - "He's not Heavy, so a proc'd Death spell from a Death Sickle axe hit will eventually get him."
  Monk:
    - "Monk fist criticals will break through his physical defense. Eventually."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mage blind is a godsend in this fight if you have to plink him down."
    - "In general, he can't do much to you if you just Armor/Protect up and leave people in the back row."
