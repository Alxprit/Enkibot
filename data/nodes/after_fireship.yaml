  Bard:
    - "Bards can play the fourth Piano in Jachol, also."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mages can learn the almost-useless Self-Destruct from Bombs near Jachol."
    - "It is very, very useful (also: funny) in one particular boss fight, so get it."
  Geomancer:
    - "The cave near Jachol has Skull Eater encounters for 5 ABP and a common Elixir drop."
    - "They are extremely brutal, but !Gaia oneshots them with Stalactite and confuses them with Ignus Fatuus whenever it doesn't get that."
    - "This is a great grind spot for ABP and Elixirs."
  Generic`:
    - "Black Mages, Summoners, and Bards want to visit Istory at this point."
    - "Parties with weak single target offense and no White Mage may also want to consider a Flame Ring, but 50k is a lot of gil."

    - "Black Mages can pick up the Toad spell from a NPC in Istory. Walk in a circle on the flowers in the top-left of the town."
  Summoner:
    - "Summoners can learn Ramuh from an encounter outside Istory."
  Thief:

  Bard`:
    - "Bards can learn Romeo's Ballad in Istory, which Stops all enemies."
    - "In addition to being situationally useful against bosses, it's an incredible trash-clearing tool all the way to the Rift."
    - "They can also play the fifth piano in Crescent, along with Mighty March (mostly for a complete song list; Regen is rarely useful)."

  INTERSECTION Summoner Ninja:
    - "Parties with reliable AoE magic, like !Summon or thrown scrolls, can farm a small island north of Crescent for XP and AP."
    - "The only encounter there is 5 Black Flames, which have high evade but melt to any AoE fire/ice/lightning/water magic."
  Blue-Mage`:
    - "The small island north of Crescent is a pro visit for Blue Mages, who can learn Dark Spark from the Black Flame enemies there."
    - "It halves the target's level, which trivializes large swaths of the game combined with L5 Death and L2 Old."
  Beastmaster:

    - "It's pretty good XP/ABP."
