  Generic:
  - "8100 HP, Bartz and Krile only."
  - "This fight can be a pain with slow offense, since it'll spam Dischord to halve your level repeatedly."
  Staff:
  - "Unless you had the foresight to farm a Power Staff in Meatfort. It casts Berserk when wielded."
  White-Mage:
  - "Berserk and Blink make this fight trivial."
  Red-Mage:
  - "Power Staff access lets you Berserk, so at least your levels will remain intact."
  UNION Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:

  Beastmaster:
  - "If you didn't plan ahead, the only available !Release is 1016 damage from the Goblin in the trapped chest in Tule's training house."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "1000 Needles isn't affected by your levels. 8 and spare change will kill Antlion."
  - "Antlion is vulnerable to both Old and Slow, so Time Slip is great here, and also Blind if you care."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Comet provides a source of level-independent damage."
  - "Antlion is vulnerable to Old and Slow, so you can weaken it while you Comet it into oblivion."
  Ninja:
  - "Antlion is weak to water, so Water Scrolls are very effective."
