  Generic:
  - "8100 HP, Bartz and Krile only."
  - "Pain in the ass if your offense is slow, since he spams Dischord (level half) which makes it slower."
  INTERSECTION Red-Mage White-Mage:
  - "Berserking him and dealing with the physical attacks is probably the easiest path with a White Mage."
  - "Blinding him would also basically neuter his offense."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you didn't plan ahead, the only available !release is from the trapped chest in Tule's training house."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "1000 Needles at least isn't affected by your levels. 8 and spare change will kill Antlion."
