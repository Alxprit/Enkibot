    previous-nodes:
    - exdeath_w2
  Generic:
  - "8100 HP, Bartz and Krile only."
  - "Pain in the ass if your offense is slow, since he spams Dischord (level half) which makes it slower."
  Staff:
  - "Unless you had the foresight to farm a Power Staff in Meatfort. It casts Berserk when wielded."
  White-Mage:
  - "Berserking him and dealing with the physical attacks is probably the easiest path with a White Mage."
  Red-Mage:
  - "Red Mages can Berserk him with the Power Staff, which puts an end to the level-halving."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you didn't plan ahead, the only available !release is from the trapped chest in Tule's training house."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "1000 Needles at least isn't affected by your levels. 8 and spare change will kill Antlion."
  - "Blinding him would also basically neuter his offense."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Time Mages can serve him up some of his own medicine with Old."
  Ninja:
  - "He's eak to water, so Water Scrolls are effective even once your level tanks."
