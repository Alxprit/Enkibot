    - "F4: 1600 HP, absorbs lightning, not Heavy, inflicts paralysis."
    - "F5: 2500 HP, absorbs wind+ice+fire+lightning, has previous attacks and charm."
    - "Magic-heavy teams may have to knife the last form to death painfully and slowly."
  Berserker:
    - "Since berserker axes mostly ignore defense, they can reliably damage all five forms."
  Ninja:
    - "Water Scrolls are solid offense against the first four forms; he'll never absorb Water."
  Monk:
    - "If you can kill a form with a Monk's Counter, it skips the trigger that causes the next form to spawn."
  Time-Mage:
    - "You can land Slows on problem forms, if you feel like it."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Aerora the first form to death."
    - "You can L5 Death the last form and the last form only, but that's the hard one anyway."
    - "Hint: Death Claw will land on forms 2 and 4, so you only have to have an answer for F3."
    - "(by the way, the answer is 2x dark spark + l5 death)"
    - "God, blue mage is broken."
  Geomancer:
    - "The first form is, like, geomancer's one time to shine. Go for it!!!"
  Summoner:
    - "Chocobo, your time is now! (It does physical damage and therefore will work on form 5)."
    - "Unless you're on iOS hahaha fuck you they 'fixed' that."
  Beastmaster:
    - "You can use Bearagas on the first and last form, which can otherwise give beastmaster parties trouble."
    - "If you don't have Sand Bears stocked, the Ronka Knights in here still !release for ~1500."
