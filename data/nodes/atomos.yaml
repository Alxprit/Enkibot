  Generic:
  - "19997 HP, spams comet until someone dies then starts sucking them in."
  - "Just come in with someone dead so you can at least choose who you have down."
  - "Revive them right before they get eaten and let Atomos kill someone else to buy more DPS uptime."
  INTERSECTION White-Mage Chemist:
  - "!White or !Mix are the two defensive abilities good enough to possibly let you just tank comets."
  - "Wouldn't really try it though, unless you have no better plan."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Dark Shock + Level 5 Death."
  - "Yup. Could take a while to actually get Dark Shock to stick, though."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:
  - "Sleep (and Sleep Sword) inflict the only aliment that Atomos is weak to."
  - "Once you have him sleeping, you can just kill him without waking him up with magic or !Mineuchi/!SwdSlap or something."
  - "!Mineuchi/!SwdSlap is 'fixed' on iOS and wakes sleeping enemies!"
  INTERSECTION Red-Mage Knight:
  - "You have a class that can equip swords, which means you can Slumber Sword Atomos if you have to."
  - "Once you have him sleeping, you can just kill him without waking him up with magic or !Mineuchi/!SwdSlap or something."
  - "!Mineuchi/!SwdSlap is 'fixed' on iOS and wakes sleeping enemies!"
  Generic`:
  - "Most parties without access to a dirty trick can simply win a DPS race against Atomos."
