  Generic:
  - "27900 HP, casts only !Blue spells."
  - "Go in with an odd level not divisible by 5 (he doesn't know L3 Flare) to neuter his Level X spells."
  - "Technically optional; all you get from him is a save point."
  Break-Rods:
  - "He's weak to poison, so you can just snap a ton of Venom Rods over his head and be done with it."
  - "The Wonder Rod will also let you Reflect him if you have it, which is super funny when he Mighty Guards."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Your Blue Mage can actually 'teach' him a few spells, causing him to try it out on you."
  - "You can teach him Exploder ahahahahahah i'm serious do it."
  - "But first, check if there's any good !Blue spells he uses that you missed; you can learn them here."
  - "If your party is divisible by level 3, you have Reflect Rings, and you want an even funnier kill than Exploder, teach him Level 3 Flare."
