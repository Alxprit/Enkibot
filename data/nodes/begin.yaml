  Generic:
    - "Here are some basic general tips based on the classes you've selected..."
  Knight:
    - "The Knight seems straightforward, but the combo of !Guard + Cover is amazing."
    - "If the party is in critical HP, you ignore all single-target physical attacks."
    - "This is especially brutal with a way to inflict Berserk."
    - "(White, Red, and Blue Mages can do so easily; staff and rod-users can later on)."
  Monk:
    - "Monks do amazing damage at first, but rapidly taper off after World 1."
    - "Barehanded attacks can crit, allowing you to penetrate high physical defense."
    - "HP+XX% abilities can allow your squishier classes to survive the final boss' Almagests."
    - "The Deep Sea Trench has the Kaiser Knuckles which can boost your monk's damage output, but not by enough."
    - "Seriously, you can't wear them together with Hermes Sandals, so they're pretty much trash."
    - "Most parties will just use their monk as a very durable itembot later in the game."
  Thief:
    - "Thieves have access to some very good stuff early on."
    - "Unfortunately, bad stats and garbage gear options probably make Thief the worst of the Wind jobs overall."
    - "I'll try to note particuarily juicy steals as the walkthrough goes on."
    - "The capstone Thief ability, Footwork, grants +16 agility which is actually a lot."
    - "Lastly, remember that the Thief's !Mug ability is a safe way to use the Chicken Knife."
  Black-Mage:
    - "Black Mage is pretty broken."
    - "Black Mages should remember Rods also enhance the power of elemental spells by +50%."
    - "just blow up everything in the game, black magic's damage output is obscene."
    - "Your currently equipped weapon can be changed from the Item Menu."
    - "Flare kind of sucks. It's not worth doing Fork Tower for by itself."
    - "If your party is Reflected, you can bounce a groupcast spell off for 2x damage."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mage is pretty broken."
    - "The White Mage's Protect and Shell allow you to sandbag almost any encounter endlessly."
    - "Many bosses are vulnerable to the Confuse, Silence, and Berserk status effects."
    - "Berserk is especially effective when combined with Blink/Image."
    - "Casting Mini on the party raises their evasion into the stratosphere if they have a shield."
    - "Once you have it, Holy is a fantastic single target damage option, on par with other power classes."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mage is completely broken."
    - "Highlights: one-shot 50+% of the bosses in the game with Dark Spark + L5 Death."
    - "Goblin Punch is a safe way to wield the Chicken Knife and Excalipoor on a physical class."
    - "Goblin Punch also does 8x (wtf) damage to enemies of the same level, which may be abusable."
    - "White Wind is the best healing spell in the game, and works on Bonemail wearers."
    - "L2 Old isn't as impressive as L5 Death, but trivializes several very hard fights."
    - "Mighty Guard is basically farewell to being worried about straight damage, forever."
    - "With the wind-boosting Air Lancet, the Aero/ra/ga line of spells is solid damage."
  Berserker:
    - "Berserker is, all joking aside, a surprisingly solid class."
    - "It's when you're assigned multiples that you start having trouble."
    - "They hit super hard, get plate armor, and can equip daggers if accuracy is a thing."
    - "Special shoutout to the Death Sickle you can farm in late World 1."
    - "It can cast Doom when it hits, and you can scam instant kills on a lot of bosses with it."
    - "Special comedy option: berzerkers with a mage command are brutal with a Rune Axe equipped."
    - "That's 'comedy' as in 'it's comedic how fast the boss melts', by the way."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knight is completely broken."
    - "Status effect sword magic has a 100% chance to land for all non-immune enemies."
    - "Several bosses have status effect 'immunity' via high magic evade; you ignore that."
    - "Level-3 elemental swords instantly kill anything with a weakness to it, or do 9999 to Heavy."
    - "Use Drain or status swords in random encounters; elemental swords do nothing vs. neutral."
    - "If you need to quickly disenchant a sword, just un/re-equip it from the item menu."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Time mage is on the precipice of completely broken."
    - "Time Mages may not be able to heal, but they can use the Healing Staff from Tycoon."
    - "They can also break rods if they need insane damage before they get Comet."
    - "The Slow spell is available early and works on, like, everything."
    - "Comet and Meteor do damage independent of your stats/gear and cannot be reflected."
    - "Time-based effects like regen continue during Quick, making regen a full heal."
    - "You can kill anything in the game (very slowly) by casting Quick, snapping a Venom Rod, and fast forwarding."
  Summoner:
    - "Summoner is pretty broken."
    - "They have incredible damage output, but will generally only have one 'good' element at a time."
    - "Remember that you can always snap an elemental rod at need for fire/lightning/ice."
    - "Don't bother not learning optional summons to boost !Call; it's just not very good."
    - "Air Lancet boosted Syldras are your best offensive option through the endgame."
    - "This makes the side quests to get Bahamut and Leviathan kind of pointless."
    - "Don't underestimate Golem: he can singlehandedly neuter physical-heavy bosses."
    - "...or anyone you can land Berserk on, which Summoners can with the Wonder Rod..."
  Red-Mage:
    - "Sorry, Red mage blows, unless you have another mage and the patience for Doublecast."
    - "By itself, Red Mage's only offense is rod snapping. Stock up."
    - "Yes, they can equip swords. Yes, they have absolutely no strength and less survivability."
    - "There's a surprising amount of utility in low-level White Magic, especially with Doublecast."
    - "Being able to heal/protect/raise 2 twice in one action is surprisingly good."
    - "You can also stick Confuse/Silence/Sleep onto enemies much more reliably."
    - "If the rest of your party is strong, I wouldn't advise grinding out Doublecast, though."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmaster is completely broken, but it takes significant amounts of effort."
    - "!Releasing the correct monster will trivialize any boss fight."
    - "I've tried to note in the individual boss entries the best release I know of."
    - "Remember that Beastmasters aren't the worst physically, and can attack from the back row."
    - "Whips are actually really solid weapons; there are a few edge case uses for Equip Whips."
  Geomancer:
    - "hahaha you got geomancer"
    - "!gaia sucks"
    - "bell weapons suck"
    - "their base stats suck"
    - "just job fair it"
    - "secretly amazing in iOS since they changed how !gaia works, it's super bullshit 64 now"
  Ninja:
    - "The Ninja's Dual Wield is as good as ever, especially on other classes."
    - "Having it on the off-hand is a safe way to wield the Chicken Knife."
    - "But the real power ability is often !Throw. The scrolls have a higher base power than level 3 magic!."
    - "Remember that most abilities 'grant' a stat increase to go with it."
    - "Giving a Ninja a high magic ability like !Summoner or !White makes scrolls completely obscene."
    - "Also: did you know that the elemental rods boost the elemental scrolls by 50%?"
    - "You can just bury everything in the game, including the final boss, in a hail of anime wallscrolls."
  Bard:
    - "The Bard is secretly one of the best classes in the game."
    - "Equip Harps transfers great agility and magic, which is nice for Rune Axe zerkers, ninjas, etc."
    - "Love Song and Charm Song are fantastically effective against random encounters."
    - "The stat-boosting songs allow you to steamroll any boss you can stay alive against."
    - "The final boss ain't got nothing on a level 255 party with 99 strength, magic, and speed."
  Ranger:
    - "Ranger is pretty broken, but not until you pony up 600 AP."
    - "The Ranger's signature ability is !X-fight/!Rapidfire, which hits 4 times for half damage."
    - "It also never misses, procs Magic Sword, ignores defense (!) and is Chicken Knife OK (!!)."
    - "also they can use bows and summon animals like jrpg saint francis i guess"
    - "If you're between level 10 and 19, you'll usually get a powerful heal-all effect from !Animals."
  Samurai:
    - "The Samurai is basically a big beefcake with a few dirty tricks available at need."
    - "Katanas can crit, ignoring physical defense."
    - "!Giltoss/!Zeninage is expensive, but it's amazing all-target damage."
    - "!Slash/!Ianuki is a fucking 85% chance of instant death to all enemies."
    - "A surprising number of bosses are not Heavy, and are therefore vulnerable to this."
  Dragoon:
    - "The dragoon is a beefcake with almost no dirty tricks available. Vanilla but decent."
    - "!Lancet is a last-resort method for any mages you have to restore their own MP mid-fight."
    - "It's straight up unuseably bad off a Dragoon's innate magic score, though."
    - "Remember that !Jump does full damage when used from the back row."
    - "Careful timing and knowledge of boss patterns also allows you to dodge nasty attacks."
  Dancer:
    - "Dancers are an extremely squishy front-row class which is way too luck-dependent."
    - "But in the 1/4 chance that they roll Sword Dance on !Dance, they're amazing."
    - "If you got Monk, Barehand is compatible with Sword Dance and really funny, since it can crit."
    - "Certain pieces of gear boost the rate of Sword Dances, amping their lategame offense."
    - "Sword Dance is also, at need, a safe way to wield the Chicken Knife."
    - "The real benefit of rolling Dancer is the ability to learn Equip Ribbon."
    - "Being able to ignore almost all status effects is exactly as dumb as it sounds."
  Chemist:
    - "Chemist can solo the game, effortlessly. It's obscene. It makes Blue Mage look bad."
    - "!Drink allows them to haste themselves and double HP, making survivability easy."
    - "But the real power of the class is in !Mix... (http://i.imgur.com/MBJBNvG.gif)"
    - "Their staple is Drain Kiss (Turtle Shell + Maiden's Kiss), which is a fucking power-255 Drain."
    - "That's stronger than Meteor, Holy, and Flare, available in World 1, and heals the user too."
    - "Turtle Shell mixes can also haste, protect, shell, cure, revive, MP refresh."
    - "!Mix can also give elemental/status immunities and inflict aliments with 100% accuracy."
    - "There are also 'Super Saiyan' strategies wherein a Chemist becomes immune to literally everything using !Mix."
