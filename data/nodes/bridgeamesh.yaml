    previous-nodes:
    - galuf_castle
  Generic:
  - "6500 HP, goes super saiyan by casting haste+armor+shell at 2500 and starts spamming jump."
  - "This fight is much, much easier if you can prevent the buffs from being cast."
  White-Mage:
  - "Protect will also make it possible to just slug it out against boosted Gilgamesh."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Muting the battle before you push him below 2500 will work."
  - "A better plan is probably just to get Slow to stick to him."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can Magic Hammer their way through Gil's 1000 MP before phasing him, causing the buffs to fail."
  UNION Blue-Mage Beastmaster:
  - "Alternatively, 1000 Needles will simply let you blast through his 2500 HP phase in 3 hits."
  Dragoon:
  - "It'll take forever, but in the worst case scenario !Lancet can be used to drain Gil's 1000 MP before phasing him, causing the buffs to fail."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can mix up Lamia's Kiss and Dark Ethers to effortlessly drain Gil's 1000 MP before phasing him, causing the buffs to fail."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can simply blast through him, if you thought to save some Bearagas from World 1."
  Generic`:
  - "In the SNES version only, you can try getting lucky with a Mage Masher as you push Gil below 2500."
  - "Otherwise, most parties can simply win a DPS race against boosted Gil, if you're careful about when you push him."
