  Metadata:
    next-node: after_fireship
    previous-nodes: ['ifrit']
  Generic:
    - "3600 HP, uses a variety of debilitating spells which make prolonged engagements almost unwinnable."
    - "He also can cast Protect on himself and will counter attacks with Drain when low."
    - "That combination makes the fight brutal on parties with only physical damage."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Happily, you can just snap a couple of Fire Rods over his head and call it a night."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "Or you could just Fira him into the ground if you're feeling cheap."
  Knight:
    - "Knights should be relying on Two-Handed in this fight and any other fight where counterattacks are an issue."
  Ninja:
    - "I hope you got that Flame Scroll from Liquid Flame if you don't have a better strategy for doing this!"
    - "You could also have farmed them in the Ship Graveyard all the way back."
    - "If you want to walk all that way back, they drop from Mindflushers in the room where the World Map was."
  Berserker:
    - "Zerker-heavy teams can have trouble here, because they can trigger Byblos' counters at bad times."
    - "If you have other powerful characters or a way to cheese the fight, consider coming in with your zerk blinded."
  Summoner:
    - "Cast your new Ifrit summon on him for some extra comedy."
  Geomancer:
    - "Geomancers rejoice! !Gaia here gets you Will-o-Wisp, which is Fire damage."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Time Mages with an aversion to rod abuse can still land Slow on him, making the fight much easier."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Death Claw works on him, reducing him to single-digit HP immediately."
    - "He's not Heavy ahahahahaha."
    - "On the other hand, you probably want to learn Magic Hammer from him, which can be obnoxious as hell."
  Beastmaster:
    - "The vanilla Whip weapon Magissa dropped all that time ago will paralyze-lock Byblos."
    - "A released Page 32 from the library will cast Banish, which has a 33% chance of straight up killing Byblos."
