    previous-nodes: ['ifrit']
  Generic:
    - "3600 HP, uses a variety of debilitating spells which make prolonged engagements almost unwinnable."
    - "He also can cast Protect on himself and will counter attacks with Drain when low."
    - "That combination makes the fight brutal on parties with only physical damage."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Happily, you can just snap a couple of Fire Rods over his head and call it a night."
  Ninja:
    - "I hope you got that Flame Scroll from LiquiFlame if you don't have a better strategy for doing this!"
  Berserker:
    - "Zerker-heavy teams can have trouble here, because they can trigger Byblos' counters at bad times."
    - "If you have other powerful characters or a way to cheese the fight, consider coming in with your zerk blinded."
  Summoner:
    - "Cast your new Ifrit summon on him for some extra comedy."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Death Claw works on him, reducing him to single-digit HP immediately."
    - "He's not Heavy ahahahahaha."
    - "On the other hand, you probably want to learn Magic Hammer from him, which can be obnoxious as hell."
  Beastmaster:
    - "A released Page 32 from the library will cast Banish, which has a 33% chance of straight up killing Byblos."
