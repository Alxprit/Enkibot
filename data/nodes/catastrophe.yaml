  - "Just don't use a Cottage once you're Floating."
  Time-Mage:
  - "...or just cast the Float spell with your Time Mage."
  Chemist:
  - "...or just use the Levisalve !Mix with your Chemist."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "...or just use the Mighty Guard, which gives Float."
  Generic`:
  - "Of course, some parties have the HP/healing/offense to just eat Earth Shakers and kill Catastrophe normally."
