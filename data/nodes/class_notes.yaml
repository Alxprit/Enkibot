  Generic:
    - "Here are some basic general tips based on the classes you've selected..."
  Knight:
    - "The Knight seems straightforward, but the combo of !Guard + Cover is amazing."
    - "If the party is in critical HP, you ignore all single-target physical attacks."
    - "This is especially brutal with a way to inflict Berserk."
    - "(White Mages can do so easily with a spell; staff and rod-users can later on)."
    - "So can Chemists, though if you have Chemist you probably don't need this to win."
    - "Bear in mind that even if you have Two-Handed equipped, you CAN equip a Shield mid-combat through the item menu."
    - "This will take away your Two-Handed damage bonus until unequip the shield, but can be useful with elemental absorption shields."
  Monk:
    - "Monks do amazing damage at first, but rapidly taper off after World 1."
    - "Barehanded attacks can crit, allowing you to penetrate high physical defense."
    - "'HP +X%' abilities can allow your squishier classes to survive the final boss's Almagest."
    - "The Deep Sea Trench has Kaiser Knuckles to boost your monk's damage output... but still not by enough to give up Hermes Sandals."
    - "Most parties will just use their monk as a beefy item user or spellcaster later in the game."
  Thief:
    - "Thieves have access to some very good stuff early on."
    - "Unfortunately, bad stats and garbage gear options probably make Thief the worst of the Wind jobs overall."
    - "I'll try to note particuarily juicy steals as the walkthrough goes on."
    - "The capstone Thief ability, Artful Dodger, grants +16 agility which is actually a lot."
    - "Lastly, remember that the Thief's !Mug ability is a safe way to use the Chicken Knife."
  Black-Mage:
    - "Black Mage is pretty broken. Just blow up everything in the game, black magic's damage output is obscene."
    - "Black Mages should remember equipped Rods increase the power of matching elemental spells by 50%."
    - "Your currently equipped weapon can be changed mid-battle from the Item Menu."
    - "Flare kind of sucks. It's not worth doing Fork Tower for by itself."
    - "If your whole party is Reflected, you can bounce a groupcast spell off for double damage."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mage is pretty broken."
    - "The White Mage's Protect and Shell allow you to go toe-to-toe with almost anything."
    - "Many bosses are vulnerable to the Confuse, Silence, and Berserk status effects."
    - "Berserk is especially effective when combined with Blink to protect your party."
    - "Casting Mini on the party raises their evasion into the stratosphere if they have a shield."
    - "Once you have it, Holy is a fantastic single target damage option, on par with other power classes."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mage is completely broken."
    - "Highlights: one-shot 50+% of the bosses in the game with Dark Spark + L5 Death."
    - "http://gfycat.com/TerrificKeyEmperorshrimp"
    - "Goblin Punch also does 8x damage to enemies of the same level, which may be abusable."
    - "Note that Vampire is bugged to do full damage and equal healing in GBA, but only heals half that in SNES and mobile versions."
    - "White Wind is the best healing spell in the game, and even works on Bone Mail wearers."
    - "L2 Old isn't as impressive as L5 Death, but trivializes several otherwise difficult fights and can combo with L5 Death."
    - "Mighty Guard is basically farewell to being worried about straight damage, forever."
    - "With the wind-boosting Air Knife, the Aero/ra/ga line of spells is solid damage."
  Berserker:
    - "Berserker is, all joking aside, a surprisingly solid class."
    - "It's when you're assigned multiples that you start having trouble."
    - "They hit super hard, get plate armor, and can equip daggers if accuracy is a thing."
    - "Special shoutout to the Death Sickle you can farm in late World 1."
    - "It can cast Death when it hits, and you can scam instant kills on a lot of bosses with it."
    - "Berserkers with a mage command equipped are brutal with a Rune Axe."
    - "On the SNES version only, a Berserker (3 magic) with a Thornlet (-5 magic) underflows to 253 magic."
    - "The Gaia Hammer, which casts Quake when attacking, deals stupid amounts of damage with those stats."
    - "If you've got a 3+ berserker fiesta, I strongly encourage you to start on SNES."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knight is completely broken."
    - "Status effect spellblades have a 100% chance to land for all non-immune enemies."
    - "Several bosses have status effect 'immunity' via high magic evade; you completely ignore that."
    - "-aga Spellblades instantly kill anything with a weakness to it, or do 9999 to Heavy targets."
    - "Use Drain or status swords in random encounters; elemental swords do nothing vs. neutral."
    - "If you need to quickly disenchant a sword, just un/re-equip it from the item menu mid-combat."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Time Mage is on the precipice of completely broken."
    - "Time Mages may not be able to heal, but they can use the Healing Staff from Tycoon."
    - "They can also break rods if they need insane damage before they get Comet."
    - "The Slow spell is available early and works on, like, everything."
    - "Comet and Meteor do damage independent of your stats/gear and cannot be reflected."
    - "Time-based effects like Regen continue during Quick, making Regen a full heal if you have the patience."
    - "You can kill literally anything in the game (very slowly) by casting Quick, snapping a Poison Rod with your first action, and waiting hours without taking your second action."
  Summoner:
    - "Summoner is pretty broken."
    - "They have incredible damage output, but will generally only have one 'good' element at a time."
    - "Remember that you can always snap an elemental rod for higher-power fire/lightning/ice damage."
    - "Don't bother deliberately skipping optional summons to boost !Call; it's just trash regardless."
    - "Air Lancet boosted Syldras are your best offensive option through the endgame."
    - "This makes the side quests to get Bahamut and Leviathan basically pointless."
    - "Don't underestimate Golem: he can singlehandedly neuter physical-heavy bosses."
    - "...or anyone you can land Berserk on, which Summoners can (once per fight) with the Wonder Rod."
  Red-Mage:
    - "Sorry, Red Mage kind of blows, unless you have another mage and the patience for Dualcast."
    - "By itself, Red Mage's only good offense is rod snapping. Stock up."
    - "Yes, they can equip swords. Yes, they have absolutely no strength and less survivability."
    - "More importantly, they can equip staves, granting early access to Cura (Healing Staff) and any access at all to Berserk (Power Staff) and Dispel (Judgment Staff)."
    - "There's a surprising amount of utility in low-level White Magic, especially with Dualcast."
    - "Being able to Protect or Raise twice in one action is surprisingly good."
    - "You can also stick Confuse/Silence/Sleep onto enemies much more reliably."
    - "If the rest of your party is strong, I wouldn't advise grinding out Dualcast, though."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmaster is completely broken, but it takes significant amounts of effort."
    - "!Releasing the correct monster will trivialize any boss fight."
    - "Each individual boss entry has a suggested !Release noted. For more details, check this spreadsheet: http://tinyurl.com/catchspreadsheet"
    - "Remember that Beastmasters aren't the worst physically, and Whips can attack from the back row."
    - "!Calm also works on a surprisingly large amount of things, and can be used to stunlock several annoying bosses."
  Geomancer:
    - "!Gaia is tricky to work around, but can pull out powerful effects sometimes."
    - "Many of the stronger !Gaia effects are Wind-based, so Air Knives make Geomancer much better."
    - "Bells are weird; don't be fooled by their attack stat. They work like Rune weapons, except using Agility instead of Strength, and Geomancer has good Magic as well."
    - "The Mobile version changed !Gaia to always roll the full 1-100 results table independent of level, which can be both good and bad."
  Ninja:
    - "The Ninja's Dual Wield is as good as ever, especially on other classes."
    - "Having the Twin Lance in the main hand ignores the Chicken Knife's Flee chance in non-mobile versions."
    - "But the real power ability is often !Throw. The scrolls have a higher base power than level 3 magic!"
    - "Giving a Ninja a magic ability like !Summon or !White makes scrolls completely obscene."
    - "Also: did you know that having an elemental rod equipped boosts the elemental scrolls by 50%?"
    - "You can just bury everything in the game, including the final boss, in a hail of anime wallscrolls."
  Bard:
    - "The Bard is secretly one of the best classes in the game."
    - "Equip Harps transfers great agility and magic, which is nice for Rune Axe Berserkers, Throwing Ninjas, etc."
    - "Romeo's Ballad and Alluring Air are fantastically effective against random encounters."
    - "The stat-boosting songs allow you to steamroll any boss you can stay alive against."
    - "The final boss ain't got nothing on a level 99 party with 99 strength, magic, and speed."
  Ranger:
    - "Ranger is pretty broken, but not until you pony up 605 AP."
    - "The Ranger's signature ability is !Rapid Fire, which hits 4 times for half damage."
    - "...it also never misses, procs Spellblade, ignores defense (!) and doesn't proc the Chicken Knife (!!)."
    - "This rarely comes up in a fiesta, but savor the combination of Rapid Fire+Spellblade on a Freelancer if you get it."
    - "If you're between level 10 and 19, you'll often get Nightingale, a powerful heal-all effect, from !Animals."
  Samurai:
    - "The Samurai is basically a big beefcake with a few dirty tricks available at need."
    - "Katanas can crit, ignoring physical defense."
    - "!Zeninage is expensive, since it literally tosses gil, but it's amazing all-target damage on low-defense enemies."
    - "!Iainuki is an 85% chance of instant death to all enemies. A surprising number of bosses are not Heavy, and therefore vulnerable to this."
  Dragoon:
    - "The Dragoon is a beefcake with almost no dirty tricks available. Vanilla but decent."
    - "!Lance is a last-resort method for mages to restore their own MP mid-fight."
    - "It's straight up unusably bad off a Dragoon's innate magic score, though."
    - "Remember that !Jump does full damage when used from the back row."
    - "Careful timing and knowledge of boss patterns also allows you to dodge nasty attacks."
  Dancer:
    - "Dancers are an extremely squishy front-row class which is way too luck-dependent."
    - "But when !Dance rolls Sword Dance, they're amazing."
    - "If you got Monk, Barehanded is compatible with Sword Dance and really funny, since it can crit."
    - "Certain pieces of gear (just wear a Rainbow Dress, ignore Tiara and Slippers) boost the rate of Sword Dances, amping Dancer's lategame offense."
    - "Sword Dance is also a safe way to wield the Chicken Knife."
    - "The real benefit of rolling Dancer is the ability to learn Equip Ribbon. Being able to ignore almost all status effects is exactly as dumb as it sounds."
  Chemist:
    - "Chemist can carry any party. It's obscene. It makes Blue Mage look bad."
    - "!Drink allows them to haste themselves and double their HP, making survivability easy."
    - "But the real power of the class is in !Mix... (http://i.imgur.com/MBJBNvG.gif)"
    - "Their staple is Succubus Kiss (Turtle Shell + Maiden's Kiss), which is a 255 magic power version of Drain."
    - "That's stronger than Meteor, Holy, and Flare, available in World 1, and heals the user to boot."
    - "Turtle Shell mixes can also haste, protect, shell, cure, revive, and MP refresh."
    - "!Mix can also give elemental/status immunities and inflict aliments with 100% accuracy."
  Freelancer:
    - "Despite what you may think, the equipment options available to a Freelancer make it more powerful than a fair number of 'normal' classes."
    - "By endgame, a Freelancer can inflict Blind, Paralyze, Old, Sleep, Berserk, Poison, Confuse, and instant death, along with casting Dispel, Raise, and Haste for free."
    - "And that's not even getting into their ability to wear Ribbons, Aegis Shields, Bone Mail, and many other defensive options."
    - "They have acccess to all the weapons that deal bonus damage against monster types, the ability to snap rods, and surprisingly good stats even with only a few other jobs mastered."
