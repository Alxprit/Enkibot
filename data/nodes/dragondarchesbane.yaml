  Generic:
  - "Enrage is at ~13 minutes; you're on the right track if you see 4 Conflagrations go out during P1."
  - "Oops, sorry, wrong game."
  - "It's not Heavy and has no death resistance when charging Giga Flare. All parties can have the Assassin's Dagger here."
  - "Just turtle to avoid its counterattacks and kill it instantly when it changes form."
  - "If you're having trouble surviving, you can equip a Coral Ring and attack him to heal for free."
  Break-Rods:
  - "The Wonder Wand from Fork Tower can be cycled to cast Death... but you'll *probably* get blown up by hubris this way."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "If you have Holy Blade, you can 100% instant kill its charging form using that."
  Summoner:
  - "He's also vulnerable to Break, so your Summoner can inflict that on him."
  Time-Mage:
  - "You can stop him with !Time while he's charging, to get more assassin's dagger attempts."
  Beastmaster:
  - "An Executor from the Solitary Island Shrine gives you Level 5 Death, which works on the charging form."
  - "If you didn't pick one up earlier, cheesing the assassin's dagger will be faster than walking out for one."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Your Blue Mage can also just instantly kill him with level 5 death during the charging phase."
  Thief:
  - "Steals vary by form: normal form has a Flame shield and charging form has a Giant Axe."
  Samurai:
  - "If for some reason you still need it, the charging form can rarely drop a Murasame when killed."
