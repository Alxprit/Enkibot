  Generic:
  - "There was an extended FF14 joke here, but then Stormblood got an entire FFV themed raid tier and it started to feel dated."
  - "It's not Heavy and has no status resistance at all when charging Giga Flare. [Almost] All parties can have the Assassin's Dagger here."
  - "Just turtle up to avoid its counterattacks and kill it instantly when it changes form."
  - "If you're having trouble surviving, you can equip a Coral Ring and attack him to heal for free."
  Break-Rods:
  - "The Wonder Wand from Fork Tower can be cycled to cast Death... but you'll *probably* get blown up by hubris this way."
  - "<@CarbyBot> Oh my god, the Wonder Wand missed! (#25)"
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Holy Blade and Break Blade both work on the charging form."
  Summoner:
  - "Catoblepas and Odin both work on the charging form."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Banish and Stop both work on the charging form."
  Beastmaster:
  - "An Executor from the Solitary Island Shrine casts Level 5 Death on !Release, which works on the charging form."
  - "If you didn't pick one up earlier, using the Assassin's Dagger will be faster than walking out for one."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Your Blue Mage can also use Level 5 Death on the charging form."
  Thief:
  - "Steals vary by form: normal form has a Flame shield and charging form has a Giant Axe."
  Samurai:
  - "If for some reason you still need it, the charging form can rarely drop a Murasame when killed."
  - "!Iainuki works on the charging form."
  UNION Ranger Freelancer:
  - "Killer Bow works on the charging form."
  Red-Mage:
  - "You can put Reflect Rings on everyone, then Dualcast any offensive spell to bait out Mega Flare counters to bounce."
  White-Mage:
  - "While a White Mage can't wield the Assassin's Dagger, Twintania's weak to Holy and Reflect Rings bounce its Mega Flare counters."
  Monk:
  - "Boy, I hope you don't have four of these, because they're literally useless without someone else's skills here. Attacking triggers Tidal Wave, so wear Coral Rings."
