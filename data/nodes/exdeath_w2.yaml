W2 Exdeath:
  Metadata:
    next-node: antlion
    previous-nodes: ["scrubamesh"]
  Generic:
    - "32768 HP; phase transitions at 16000 and 7000 HP remaining."
    - "Classes without a strong way to cheese this fight should bring Reflect Rings, which... you can't get after Barrier Tower except with !Steal."
    - "If you're foregoing Reflect Rings, don't have a level divisible by 3, unless you want to die to Level 3 Flare."
    - "If you *are* bringing Reflect Rings, going in with a level divisible by 3 is actively good."
  Thief:
    - "Thieves get a chance at redemption here if you forgot Reflect Rings in the Barrier Tower; Reflect Mages have them in Meatfort."
  White-Mage:
    - "Make sure you keep Protect up; Exdeath's Vaccum Wave physicals can be surprisingly nasty."
    - "Remember that you can't actually heal party members with a Reflect Ring, unless you have a way to also Reflect Exdeath."
    - "Setting Berserk on your own characters may help with the mad rush to take his last 7000 HP."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Level 2 Old works. If you know the timing well, or try a lot, you can wait for a multiple of 5 and use Level 5 Death to end the fight."
    - "That said, it may be worth stalling the first form long enough to learn Level 3 Flare."
  UNION Beastmaster Blue-Mage:
    - "If you bothered getting Level 3 Flare before now, that's solid damage at this point. Otherwise just Aeroga spam."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Do not use Slow. Exdeath will counters with Haste, which overwrites Slow instead of neutralizing it."
    - "Do use Float on your party to avoid Earth Shaker; even if he uses 100 Gs it wastes a turn (and you can recast to waste another)."
  UNION Time-Mage White-Mage:
    - "If you can Reflect Exdeath and bounce a Slow off your own party, the resulting Haste counter bounces off too."
  Summoner:
    - "Make sure you keep Golem up; Exdeath's Vaacum Wave physicals can be surprisingly nasty."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Releasing four Yellow Dragons (8192 damage each) will instantly kill Exdeath."
  Ninja:
    - "Consider !Throwing your Excalipoor or the Fuma Shuriken from two floors down to get past Exdeath's last 7000 HP."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knights may have luck with applying Drain Sword and just trying to DPS race Exdeath."
  Bard:
    - "Going Super Saiyan on Exdeath with Swift Song is technically possible but tricky, unless you have a way around Condemn."
  Chemist:
    - "Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) blocks Condemn, allowing you to go Super Saiyan in peace if you feel like it."
    - "Exdeath is weak to Holy; chugging a Giant's Drink and then spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water) works."
  Staff:
    - "Staff-wielding parties can grind for Staves of Light in Ghido's Cave; snapping them does about 4000 damage per Staff."
    - "This also takes forever and should very much be treated as a last resort - that said, it's a good way to get Exdeath below 16000 for the phase change."
    - "If you're still relying on the Healing Staff, remember that it won't work on anyone wearing a Reflect Ring."
  NOT Healing:
    - "Players with weak healing options should consider reading Exdeath's AI script to understand when he will cast Zombie Breath, which can spell a wipe for parties at low HP when it's cast."
  Shield:
    - "Consider carefully what secondary loadout you give your Aegis Shield user; if things start going south they will likely be the one responsible for saving the fight with revives/healing."
