  NOT Dancer:
  - "The fights with the old men in the downstairs cells that turn into Jura Aevises is optional and pointless without a Dancer."
  Dancer:
  - "If you still need Red Shoes or Rainbow Dresses, there's one of each in the downstairs cells if you fight the Jura Aevises."
  Generic`:
  - "Iron Giants are common in random encounters here. They're worth 10k experience each but are relatively tough."
  - "They only use physical attacks, but hit hard. They're vulnerable to Death and Petrify."
