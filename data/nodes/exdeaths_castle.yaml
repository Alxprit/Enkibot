  Generic:
  - "If you have strong AoE, the 2x Sword Dancer + 2x Death Claw encounter in the lobby is easy experience and ABP."
  - "Make sure you grab a Hermes Sandals from a treasure chest in the Castle; if you only had 3, there you go."
  NOT Dancer:
  - "The fight with the old men in the downstairs cells that turn into Jura Aevis is optional and pretty pointless."
  Dancer:
  - "If you still need Red Shoes or Rainbow Dresses, there's one of each in the downstairs cells if you fight the Jura Aevis."
  Generic`:
  - "Iron Giants are common in random encounters here. They're worth 10k experience each but are relatively tough."
  - "They only use physical attacks, but hit hard. Ideally, they're vulnerable to Death and Petrify."
