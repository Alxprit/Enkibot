  Generic:
  - "Consider carefully whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons; many parties do not."
  - "Magic users go to the left and physical fighters go to the right."
  - "The Defender in Fork Tower is a Knight Sword that might be interesting if Excalibur didn't exist."
  - "It can be used as an item to cast Protect, which may be useful for certain very squishy parties."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Many rod-using parties can take good advantage of the Wonder Rod in Fork Tower, especially if they lack !White."
  - "It cycles through almost every spell in the game in a particular order."
  White-Mage:
  - "Fork Tower is the only way to learn Holy, which gives White Mages (fantastic) offense if required."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:
  - "Fork Tower is the only way to learn Flare for Black Mages (eh) and Flare Blade for Mystic Knights (!!)."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Mystic Knights can also use Holy Blade, which is useful-ish like once (Twin Tania) but it's really funny."
  Generic`:
  - "Classes that need no special Fork Tower loot will often want to skip it, since frankly Istory Falls and the Deep Sea Trench suck."
