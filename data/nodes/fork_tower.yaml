  Generic:
  - "Consider carefully whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons; many parties do not."
  - "Magic users go to the left and physical fighters go to the right."
  - "The Defender in Fork Tower is a Knight Sword that might be interesting if Excalibur didn't exist."
  - "It can be used as an item to cast Protect, which may be useful for certain very squishy parties."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Many rod-using parties can take good advantage of the Wonder Rod in Fork Tower, especially if they lack !White."
  - "It cycles through all the !White and !Black spells in a particular order."
  - "This gives rod-users guaranteed access to Berserk, as well as Death, Reflect, Protect, Shell, and others."
  White-Mage:
  - "Fork Tower is the only way to learn Holy, which gives White Mages (fantastic) offense."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Fork Tower is the only way to learn Flare for Black Mages (meh) and get the Wonder Rod, which is honestly more important."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Fork Tower is the only way to learn Flare for Flare !Spellblade, which is far better than the spell itself. You should do it."
  Generic`:
  - "Classes that don't need specific loot from Fork Tower, the Deep Sea Trench, or Istory Falls should just go to the Rift now."
