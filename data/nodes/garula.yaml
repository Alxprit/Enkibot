Garula:
  Metadata:
    next-node: tycoon_treasure
    previous-nodes: ['walse_tower']
  Generic:
    - "1200 HP, begins countering every attack with Rush at 800 HP."
    - "A definite trainwreck waiting to happen for unlucky and unprepared players."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Of course, you could pretty much just toast him with one snapped rod farmed from a RicardMage downstairs."
  Knight:
    - "Knights can cheese this fight hilariously with three critical-HP characters and one spamming Cover."
    - "Garula can't do anything to you, it's hysterical."
    - "Well, OK, he can still inflict HP Sap. Bring a few potions or something."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mages can cast Protect to make Garula's offense half as dangerous."
    - "For 4x WHM parties: put everyone in the back row and ONLY attack with the Flail to minimize counterattacks."
    - "It's easy enough to grind out. Also completely infuriating."
  Thief:
    - "4x Thief parties should have a mythril knife attacker in the front row and 3 potion chuckers in the back row."
    - "Seriously expect to burn through 50-60+ potions if you're at a reasonable level and haven't been grinding."
  Monk:
    - "The Monk's !Focus, which lets you hit twice as hard half as often, completely trivializes the counterattack mechanic."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can get Frog Song to apply to Garula. He can cure himself, but he'll keep wasting turns."
    - "Garula can't counterattack while frogged, either."
    - "Blind will also stick to him, if for some reason frog abuse isn't enough."
