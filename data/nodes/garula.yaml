  Generic:
    - "1200 HP, begins countering every attack with Rush at 800 HP."
    - "A definite trainwreck waiting to happen for unlucky and unprepared players."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Of course, you can also farm up a Fire Rod from a Ricard Mage downstairs, or use the Frost Rod from Carwen."
  Knight:
    - "Knights can cheese this fight hilariously with three critical-HP characters and one Knight with spamming !Guard."
    - "Garula can't do anything to you, it's hysterical."
    - "Well, OK, HP Sap still exists, so bring a few potions or something."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mages can cast Protect to make Garula's offense half as dangerous."
    - "For 4x WHM parties: put everyone in the back row and ONLY attack with the Flail to minimize counterattacks."
    - "It's easy enough to grind out. Also completely boring."
  Thief:
    - "4x Thief parties should have a Mythril Knife attacker in the front row and 3 potion chuckers in the back row."
    - "Seriously expect to burn through 50-60+ potions if you're at a reasonable level and haven't been grinding."
    - "As a corollary, check when you get your next M increase, and maybe grind to it."
  Monk:
    - "The Monk's !Focus, which lets you hit twice as hard half as often, helps immensely with the counterattack mechanic."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can get Pond's Chorus to apply to Garula. Its self-Frog-cure takes its turn, and then you can repeat."
    - "Blind will also work, if for some reason frog abuse isn't enough."
