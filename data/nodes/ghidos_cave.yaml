  Generic:
  - "To advance the plot, take the submarine visit Ghido's Cave."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "While you're there, learn Aeroga from the Enchanted Fan metamorph."
  - "It's by far the most reliable option for Blue Mages to do straight damage."
  Staff:
  - "Your staff users may appreciate the Staff of Light that sometimes drops from metamorphs."
  - "Only the Wyvern-type metamorph will drop it."
  - "Farming copies to snap may make W2 Exdeath much easier, but it's also completely mind-numbing."
  Summoner:
  - Summoners will want to stop by the Northern Island to fight Shoat/Catablopas.
  - Shoat has only 5000 HP and attacks with weak physicals or Drain.
  - However, he counterattacks with Petrify. Don't feel afraid to back off and cure.
  - HP Sap like, say, what a Summoner can inflict by snapping a Venom Rod, gets around this.
  Chemist:
  - If you're running low on Turtle Shells for your Chemist, go to the Northern Island where Shoat is.
  - The Land Turtles here drop more Turtle Shells to fuel your Drain Kiss habit.
