    - catastrophe
  Generic:
  - "33333 HP, sky-high level (affects aliment spell accuracy)."
  - "Starts by turning characters into frogs; if you come in with everyone frogged it cures you instead."
  - "Casts Holy once every eight turns; having the party Reflected will let you scam an easy kill."
  - "In general, only has single-target offense. Any party can sandbag with Phoenix Downs."
  Summoner:
  - "For whatever reason, Halicarnassus counters all offensive summons viciously."
  - "You can still just spam Carbuncle until it impales itself with Holy, though."
