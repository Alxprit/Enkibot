    previous-nodes: ['library']
  Generic:
    - "3000 HP, alternates between (Fira or Flame) and (Fight or Flame)"
    - "20% chance to evade all physicals, which can make some runs annoying."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Snapping a couple of Frost Rods on him will put him down with minimal fuss."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage Summoner:
    - "So will simply blasting away with Ice-elemental attacks, if you're feeling cheap."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knights should set Silence with a Spellblade before going to town with Blizzara Sword."
  Ninja:
    - "Ifrit is weak to water in addition to ice, so here's a good place to use your water scroll."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Aqua Rake is actually nonaspected damge, so it won't be super-effective here."
    - "He is, however, vulnerable to Blind, which will help lower incoming damage when he physically attacks."
  White-Mage:
    - "It's quite possible to land Silence on Ifrit, which cuts down on incoming damage significantly."
    - "He's also vulnerable to confuse...which will mostly cause him to Fira himself and heal."
    - "Worst case scenario, you can easily run him out of MP this way."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Ifrit is vulnerable to Slow, which you can inflict at this point with your Time Mage."
  Geomancer:
    - "Geomancers should note that Will-o-Wisp is fire damage, so...don't use that."
  Thief:
    - "The Mage Masher you stole from the Karnak 500 can be used to Silence Ifrit here."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmasters can release Zus from the grassland outside Karnak, for a solid 750 damage each."
    - "Or a Bandersnatch from near Walse for a 50/50 change of instant death. Bit of a walk, though."
