    previous-nodes: ['library']
  Generic:
    - "3000 HP, alternates between (Fira or Flame) and (Fight or Flame)"
    - "20% physical evasion, which can be annoying."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Snapping a couple of Frost Rods will work with with minimal fuss."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage Summoner:
    - "So will simply blasting away with Ice-elemental attacks, if you're low on money."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Mystic Knights should set Silence with a Spellblade before going to town with Blizzara Sword."
  Ninja:
    - "Ifrit is weak to water in addition to ice, so here's a good place to !Throw your Water Scroll."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Aqua Rake is actually nonelemental damge, so it won't be super-effective here."
    - "Ifrit is, however, vulnerable to Blind, which will help lower incoming damage when he physically attacks."
  White-Mage:
    - "It's quite possible to land Silence on Ifrit, which cuts down on incoming damage significantly."
    - "Ifrit's also vulnerable to Confuse, which will mostly lead to self-targeted Firas for lots of healing."
    - "Worst case scenario, you can stall out Ifrit's MP this way."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Ifrit is vulnerable to Slow."
  Geomancer:
    - "Geomancers should note that Will-o-Wisp is fire damage, so don't use !Gaia here."
  Thief:
    - "The Mage Masher you stole from the Karnak 500 can be used to Silence Ifrit here."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmasters can release one or more Zu from the grassland outside Karnak for a solid 750 damage each."
    - "Even better, a Bandersnatch from near Walse has a 50/50 chance of inflicting instant death. Bit of a walk, though."
    - "Ifrit is also vulnerable to Paralyze from the Whip, although 20% physical evasion makes it not a total lock singlehandedly."
