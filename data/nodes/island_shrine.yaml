  Generic:
  - "Consider carefully whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons; many parties do not."
  - "It is also required for Fork Tower and thus Istory Falls and the Deep Sea Trench."
  Thief:
  - "The Island Shrine contains the Rising Sun, the best thief weapon in the game (oh boy!!)."
  - "Mirage Vests, which grant natural Blink, can be rarely stolen from RedHarpy/Oiseaurare."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you're coming, the Beastkiller whip is situational but decent for your Beastmaster."
