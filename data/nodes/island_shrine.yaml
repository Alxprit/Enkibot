  Generic:
  - "Consider carefully whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons; many parties do not."

  Thief:
  - "The Island Shrine contains the Rising Sun, the best thief weapon in the game (oh boy!!)."
  - "Mirage Vests, which grant natural Blink, can be rarely stolen from Oiseaurare."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you're coming here for other reasons anyway, the Beast Killer whip can come in handy for a few fights later."
