  Metadata:
    next-node: leviathan
    previous-nodes:
    - those_assholes
  Generic:
  - "Istory Falls isn't useless per-se: there's a lot of good loot in here, but it rarely makes or breaks a run."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners learn Leviathan here which is...completely useless due to the lack of water-boosting weapons."
  Red Mage:
  - "Red Mages will, uh, 'appreciate' the Rune Blade here, which might make them better at killing things than, like, a geomancer."
  - "On second thought, nah."
  UNION Blue-Mage Red-Mage:
  - "There might be very weird cases where you'd equip the Enhancer, but I can't really think of any frankly."
  Ranger:
  - "Rangers can get the Artemis Bow here, which is a bow that's actually still worse than !x-fighting with the Chicken Knife."
  - "If you've got a second !x-fighter who's using a chicken knife, it's a good consolation weapon though."
  Shields:
  - "The Aegis Shield here is the real reason to run Istory: having two Aegis Shields is huge."
  - "It may or may not be worth grabbing a second: you'd have to have two shield users or Equip Shields."
  - "And it might be a whole lot of extra work for not that much benefit."
