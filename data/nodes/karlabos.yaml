  Generic:
    - "The Something Awful Forums -> Let's Play -> Let's All Solo FFV And Get Murdered By Karl Boss"
    - "650 HP; can inflict paralysis or lower a character to 1 HP. Basically the worst for solo games."
    - "Just Potion up after getting hit by Tail Screw and you'll be fine."
  INTERSECTION Knight Monk:
    - "You'd kind of have to be trying to lose with Monk or Knight."
    - "Large HP total, strong physical attacks, basically just beat him up and use a Potion after every Tail Screw."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Blue Mages should make sure they learn Vampire and Goblin Punch first from Steel Bats and, well, Goblins."
    - "Karlabos is level 5, so a level 5 Blue Mage will deal about 240 damage with Goblin Punch."
  Black-Mage:
    - "Black Mages can absolutely wreck him with Thunder, which he's weak to."
  White-Mage:
    - "If you're stuck with four White Mages, you'll probably need to grind out another point of M at level 8."
  Thief:
    - "Thief gets more points of M at levels 5 and 11. You may need to grind it out, or spend an inordinate amount of potions."
    - "Faris's starting Dagger is your strongest weapon, and two of your party members will have no weapon. Plan accordingly."
