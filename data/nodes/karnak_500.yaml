The Karnak 500:
  Metadata:
    next-node: library
    previous-nodes: ['liquiflame']
  Generic:
    - "You have 10:00 to get as much loot out of the Karnak 500 as possible."
    - "(Karnak 1000 just doesn't roll off the tongue as easily)"
    - "Have your jobs and abilities set immediately after you kill liquiflame; the Karnak 500 continues ticking in menu."
    - "It's best to look up a map if this is your first time. There's a decent one on GameFAQs."
    - "If you're having trouble with the Sergeant + Kar Nakk encounter, kill the Sergeant to make the dogs run away."
  Knight:
    - "RUN RUN RUN run. No, the Brave Blade ain't worth it. Never take the Brave Blade."
  Thief:
    - "If your offense is good, you can steal plenty of Elixirs from the Gigas enemies infesting this place."
    - "You should common-steal some Mage Mashers from the Sorceror enemy in here."
  Generic`:
    - "Try and get the Elven Mantle and Main Gauche; those are the best unconditional loot in here."
  Dancer:
    - "There's also a Ribbon! Get the Ribbon! You'll need it for your Dancer! It's rad!"
  NOT Dancer:
    - "You could let the Ribbon burn since you don't have a Dancer, but it's kind of bad form."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "You can learn Aerora from the Gigases here for your Blue Mage, though it won't be too long until you can get it again."
    - "Since the Gigases are immune to Aero, Blue Mages can have serious damage problems here."
    - "It may be worth it to run straight to the exit for Death Claw, then run back to the trapped chests."
  White-Mage:
    - "White Mages should definitely not forget about the Esuna spell in a chest here; it'll be a while till you can rebuy it."
  Generic``:
    - "You'll have to kill Iron Claw, a miniboss with 900 HP and some adds, before you exit the castle."
  Blue-Mage`:
    - "He can teach you Death Claw, and you'd be well advised to try and get it here. It's lovely against anything that's not Heavy."
    - "Don't kill the sergeant before he transforms into Death Claw, if you do decide to do this."
  NOT Blue-Mage:
    - "Don't bother fighting it out. You can prevent him from spawning simply by killing the two dogs, then punching the sergeant until he runs."
