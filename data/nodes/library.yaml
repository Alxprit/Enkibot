  Generic:
    - "On the walk down, dodge the desert unless you want to fight the powerful Dhorme Chimera."
    - "Remember that you can heal for free in the Library by drinking from the pot on the second floor."
  Chemist:
    - "The turtles infesting the grasslands around here drop Turtle Shells; you're gonna want to farm 99 of them for your Chemist."
    - "I know it sucks, but drain kiss is really really really good and you can basically run from everything else for the rest of the game."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "Your Blue Mage should learn Level 5 Death from Page 64s in the library; you'll obviously have to grind to 15 or 20 for this."
    - "You can also learn Moon Flute in here from Page 256s, which is an early way to inflict Berserk."
  Thief:
    - "Page 256es are carrying a Ninja Suit as a steal, a pretty respectable piece of cloth armor."
    - "That said, you'll be able to just buy them not too long from now."
  Geomancer:
    - "Geomancers will often get the Will-o-Wisp spell here, so they're actually good."
    - "You'd only have them on Chaos, though."
  UNION Blue-Mage Beastmaster:
    - "!Control will also let you learn Off-Guard from the same Page 256."
    - "The same for the (extremely questionably useful) Transfusion spell from Mythril Dragons outside."
