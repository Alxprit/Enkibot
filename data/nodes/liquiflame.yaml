  Generic:
    - "3000 HP, transitions randomly between three forms when struck."
    - "Human Form: single and multi target attacks and counters with target-all fire magic."
    - "Hand Form: single target attacks that can paralyze and counters with Fire 2. Absorbs fire, nullifies ALL other elements."
    - "Tornado Form: casts Fire2 on self to heal."
  Ranger:
    - "Killing Liquid Flame in Tornado Form makes it drop a Fire Bow, useful in the next dungon and not buyable until later.
  INTERSECTION White-Mage Red-Mage:
    - "It can be confused, which will have it do nothing except attack itself. Useful for choosing which drop you get!"
  Break-Rods:
    - "Frost Rods will kill in two breaks. Don't use them when it's in hand form!"
  Time-Mage:
    - "The Time Mage's Demi spell works on the human and tornado forms."
    - "One cast of Demi followed up by a Frost Rod snap on the human or tornado form will kill."
  Monk:
    - "Fewer, bigger hits will do better against him, so !Focus ain't bad here."
  Knight:
    - "The fewer times you have to hit Liquid Flame the fewer counters you'll see, so Two-Handed makes your life easier."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "Blizzara Sword will inflict massive damage. Make sure you have a way to damage hand form to turn it back to a form weak to ice."
    - "You can unequip your weapon and re-equip it through the Item menu to strip your spellblade effect. It also doesn't use your turn."
  Generic`:
    - "Since the forms' MP are tracked separately and the tornado form doesn't attack you, consider just sitting there until it runs out from 5 Fire 2 casts."
  Berserker:
    - "Consider going into the fight with your Berserker dead to control phase changes, at least until you run Tornado out of MP so it can't heal."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "All three forms absorb wind element, so don't use Aero. Just break rods."
