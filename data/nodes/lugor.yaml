  Generic:
  - "Regole can get kind of expensive, depending on your classes and whether you need to buy weapons."
  Geomancer:

  White-Mage:
  - "The magic store sells Blink and Shell, both of which are great for certain bosses."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Mystic-Knight:
  - "The magic store sells Drain, Break, and Bio, which are pretty good for Black Mages and VERY good for on Mystic Knights."
  Time-Mage:
  - "The magic store sells Comet (your Time Mage's first non-rod offensive spell!) and some other trash."
  UNION Time-Mage Thief:
  - "You can use the Return spell to keep trying for a annoying rare steals. It sucks, but it works"

  - "Boosted Titans will be a Summoner's mainstay for a long time."
  Bard:
  - "The sixth piano is in the Regole pub. Play it for your Bard."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters might want to consider making an early visit to the Sealed Castle."
  - "They can !Control the Shield Dragons in there for free kills (cast Blaze five times) to get lots of XP and ABP."
  - "Shield Dragons can also be easily captured for Almagest (~750 damage) by casting Blaze four times, which is fine if you're out of Bears."
  Generic`:
  - "The undead dinosaur in the underground passage isn't even a real boss. Just Phoenix Down him and move on."
  White Mage:
  - "You can also cast Raise rather than using Phoenix Downs. It doesn't matter, really."  
  Generic``:
  - "In the Moogle Village, you can get the Dancing Dagger, which is primarily useful for letting anyone Confuse."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "With the Dancing Dagger, your Blue Mage can finally learn most !Control-only spells, even if you don't have a Beastmaster."
