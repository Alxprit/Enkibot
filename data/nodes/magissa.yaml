  Metadata:
    next-node: walse_tower
    previous-nodes: ['north_mountain']
  Generic:
    - "650 HP; alternates between black magic and drain/fight. Summons Forza at 300 HP."
    - "Forza has 850 HP and can easily one-shot a squishy character in the front row."
  White-Mage:
    - "It's technically quite easy to sandbag your way through Magissa's 200 MP before she summons Forza, if you have !White."
  Thief:
    - "Just bring a lot of potions if you have 4 thieves. There's no real way to finesse this fight."
    - "If you're really in trouble, grind to level 16. With 4 Daggers, you can bring Magissa from 320 to dead in one set of !Fights."
  INTERSECTION Black-Mage Blue-Mage:
    - "You can snap the Frost Rod from Kerwin here for dumb amounts of damage; pushing Magissa from 300-0 like that skips Forza."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, your Blue Mage can blind Forza easily."
  Black-Mage:
    - "If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, you can also just Sleep Forza and unload on Magissa."
