  Staff:
  - "To save yourself time in world 3, farm a Power Staff from Black Warlocks."
  - "It casts Berserk when wielded, which has a number of obscure but quite useful applications."
  UNION Staff Thief:
  - "Your Thief can also steal a Judge Staff from the very same Black Warlocks."
  - "It casts Dispel when wielded, which has a number of not-very-obscure applications."
  Shield:
  - "Shield-users will appreciate the Ice Shield in a chest here, or at least they would if not for the Aegis."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Magic Dragons cast three Blue Magic spells you theoretically should have, but may have missed:"
  - "Aeroga, Guard-off, and Level 2 Old all had slightly annoying conditions to obtain the first time around."
  Ranger:
  - "You'll have to walk in lava to get the Gale/Hayate bow here, but it's worth it."
  Knight:
  - "The Blizzard knightsword isn't very good, but in conjuction with an Ice Shield it lets your Knight heal themself."
  INTERSECTION Ninja Thief:
  - "Ninjas and Thieves will appreciate the Double Lance weapon in a chest near the end."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners can get the Carbuncle summon by defeating it in a small boss fight after the final save point."
  - "Carbuncle is almost impossible to kill, but transforms into a weaker healing form after casting 3 spells on you."
  - "The healing form is not Heavy and is vulnerable to Stone. Just wait for it and cast Shoat."
  NOT Summoner:
  - "There's no real point to fighting Carbuncle if you don't have Summoner; it can be a pretty hard fight."
