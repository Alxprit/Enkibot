  Staff:
  - "To save yourself time in world 3, and open up some Triple Crown options, farm a Power Staff from Black Warlocks."
  - "It casts Berserk when wielded, which has a number of obscure but quite useful applications."
  UNION Staff Thief:
  - "Your Thief can also steal a Judgment Staff from the very same Black Warlocks."
  - "It casts Dispel when wielded, which can be useful sometimes."
  Shield:
  - "Shield-users will appreciate the Ice Shield in a chest here, or at least they would if not for the Aegis Shield."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Magic Dragons cast three Blue Magic spells you theoretically could have, but may have missed."
  - "Aeroga, Guard-off, and Level 2 Old were all annoying to obtain the first time around, at best."
  Ranger:
  - "You'll have to walk in lava to get the Hayate Bow here, but it's worth it."
  UNION Ranger Berserker:
  - "...Especially if you put Equip Bows on a Berserker and give it to them."
  Knight:
  - "The Icebrand isn't very good, but in conjuction with an Ice Shield it lets your Knight heal themselves."
  INTERSECTION Ninja Thief:
  - "Ninjas and Thieves will appreciate the Twin Lance weapon in a chest near the end."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners can get the Carbuncle summon by defeating it in a boss fight after the final save point."
  - "Carbuncle is really sturdy, but transforms into a weaker healing form after casting 3 spells on you."
  - "The healing form is not Heavy and is vulnerable to Stone. Just wait to see Cura and then cast Catoblepas."
  NOT Summoner:
  - "There's no real point to fighting Carbuncle if you don't have Summoner; it can be a pretty hard fight and the Reflect Ring was more easily farmed back in Barrier Tower"
