    - ghidos_cave
  Generic:
  - "There's a second Main Gauche in Moore, if you want it. It's in a barrel behind the pub."
  INTERSECTION Blue-Mage Summoner:
  - "Air Knives boost wind damage by 50%, making them immediately useful for Blue Mages."
  - "Summoners will enjoy these too, but not until World 3."
  White-Mage:
  - "Curaga, Berserk, and Reflect all allow you to cheese fights in various hilarious ways."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Firaga, Thundaga, and Blizzaga. Yep."
  Time-Mage:
  - "The various spells Time Mages can learn here are nice, but the real winner is Hastega."
  Bard:
  - "Bards will be happy to find the seventh piano in Moore's pub."
  Generic`:
  - "Every single goddamn encounter in Moore Forest is fucking infuriating and you should run from them all."
  Bard`:
  - "Exception: bards can spam Romeo's Ballad to inflict Stop; every random encounter is vulnerable to it."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "You may want to learn Lilliputian Lyric from Mini Magicians here, even though you'll probably never use it if you don't have Berserker."
  Generic``:
  - "You'll have to make a choice here between the Aegis Shield and the Flame Shield."
  Shield:
  - "If anyone in your party can equip shields, you want the Aegis Shield, which is infinitely better."
  - "Exception: your party has literally no other way to beat the upcoming Seal Crystals fight..."
  - "...and you forgot to buy the Flame Ring in World 1. A certain famous streamer pulled that one..."
  NOT Shield:
  - "If nobody in your party can equip shields, you may as well pick the Flame Shield because it sells for more."
  - "Of course if you do this you probably let the Ribbon in Karnak burn too. Shameful."
