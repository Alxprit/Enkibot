  Generic:
  - "Necrophobe is an optional fight! You need to kill him for the last save point before NED, though."
  - "First phase: four 8800 HP auto-reflect Barriers, which alternate between level 3 black magic and holy/flare."
  - "Second phase: 34044 effective HP, weak to all elements, spams double physical attacks/vacuum waves."
  - "Reflect rings will let you cast on yourself to penetrate the barrier reflect status."
  Heavyscammer:
  - "The barriers are vulnerable to instant death, which your party is capable of efficiently inflicting."
  NOT Heavyscammer:
  - "It might be tempting to try and Assassin's Dagger the barriers. Just be aware that Doom can be reflected..."
  Samurai:
  - "Samurai can either use !Ianuki or just !Zeninage the barrier crystals down easily."
  Summoner:
  - "Air Lancet boosted Syldras from your Summoner will let you just DPS race the barriers."
  - "If that sounds like too much work, you can also scum Shoat petrifies on the barriers."
  - "Golem will allow you to almost completely neuter the second phase's offense."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Remember that the Time Mage's Comet and Meteor ignore reflect statuses."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release Great Dragons from the X-Zone Caves for a 9999 hit, to quickly thin out the crystals."
  - "Just pray the random target selection doesn't pick Necrophobe himself."
