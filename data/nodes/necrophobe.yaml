  Generic:
  - "Necrophobe is an optional fight! You need to kill him for the last save point before NED, though."
  - "First phase: four 8800 HP auto-reflect Barriers, which alternate between Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga and Holy/Flare."
  - "Second phase: 34044 effective HP, weak to all elements, spams double physical attacks/Vacuum Waves."
  - "He'll have 44044 HP if you didn't get Excalipoor, though."
  - "Reflect Rings will let you cast on yourself to penetrate the Barriers' Reflect status."
  - "It might be tempting to try and Assassin's Dagger the barriers. Don't do it, because that Doom proc gets reflected."
  Samurai:
  - "Samurai can just !Zeninage the barrier crystals down easily."
  - "You might think to use !Iainuki, but the Barriers are heavy, so it won't work."
  Summoner:
  - "Air Knife boosted Syldra can easily DPS race the Barriers."
  - "If that sounds like too much work, you can also use Catoblepas to petrify them."
  - "Golem almost completely neuters Necrophobe's offense."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Remember that Comet and Meteor ignore Reflect. It'll take some casting of Meteor, since Necrophobe is effectively a blank target, but you'll get there."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release Great Dragons from the X-Zone Caves for to hit a random target for 9999, oneshotting a Barrier."
  - "Just pray that the random target selection doesn't pick Necrophobe."
  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid Fire to fish for Killer Bow procs works fairly well, though you will inevitably 'waste' some hits on Necrophobe."
  - "Alternatively, !Rapid Fire with the Chicken Knife, since the Barriers aren't THAT beefy."
  Freelancer:
  - "The Killer Bow's death proc doesn't reflect, so that's one option for the Barriers."
  Berserker:
  - "Don't try Death Sickles. Their Doom proc gets Reflected."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Break Blade works on the Barriers."
  - "Necrophobe is weak to every element."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Bouncing Break or Death off your own Reflect Ringed party member is an effective, if randomly targeted, way to kill the Barriers."
  Chemist:
  - "Death Potion kills Barriers."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "The Barriers are level 44, so it would take three Dark Sparks to hit them with Level 5 Death."
  - "The Barriers are heavy, so Death Claw won't work."
  - "BLU's best multi-target option is Aqua Breath here, thanks to Reflect neutralizing Aeroga."
  Thief:
  - "Don't forget the Genji Armor from Gilgamesh."
  Cannoneer:
  - "Chaos Cannon kills Barriers."
  - "Necrophobe is vulnerable to Slow and Darkness, both of which you have Cannons for."
  Gladiator:
  - "One Finisher kills the Barriers. As does several !Bladeblitzes, I guess."
