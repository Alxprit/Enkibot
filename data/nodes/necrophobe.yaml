  Generic:
  - "Necrophobe is an optional fight! You need to kill him for the last save point before NED, though."
  - "First phase: four 8800 HP auto-reflect Barriers, which alternate between level 3 black magic and holy/flare."
  - "Second phase: 34044 effective HP, weak to all elements, spams double physical attacks/vacuum waves."
  - "He'll have 44044 if you didn't get Excalipoor, though."
  - "Reflect rings will let you cast on yourself to penetrate the barrier reflect status."
  Heavyscammer:
  - "The barriers are vulnerable to instant death, which your party is capable of efficiently inflicting."
  - "Make sure that your preferred method of ID is NOT reflectable, though!"
  - "The Assassin's Dagger *is*, so maybe don't use that."
  NOT Heavyscammer:
  - "It might be tempting to try and Assassin's Dagger the barriers. Just be aware that Doom can be reflected..."
  Samurai:
  - "Samurai can just !Zeninage the barrier crystals down easily."
  - "You might think to use !Iainuki, but the Barriers are heavy, so it won't work."
  Summoner:
  - "Air Lancet boosted Syldras from your Summoner will let you just DPS race the barriers."
  - "If that sounds like too much work, you can also scum Shoat petrifies on the barriers."
  - "Golem will allow you to almost completely neuter the second phase's offense."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Remember that the Time Mage's Comet and Meteor ignore reflect statuses."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release Great Dragons from the X-Zone Caves for a 9999 hit, to quickly thin out the crystals."

  Ranger:
  - "!Rapid-fire and the Killer Bow work fairly well when you don't shoot Necrophone instead."
  Berserker:
  - "Don't try Death Sickles. They spell they cast on-hit will be reflected."
