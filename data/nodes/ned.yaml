  Generic:
  - "Image guide: http://i.imgur.com/FphWf.gif"
  - "High level strategy overview follows:"
  - "Biggest threats are: Grand Cross (random aliments), Almagest (~1700 HP all-targets), enrage (last part spams super attacks 2x/turn)"
  - "Grand Cross is mitigatable with Hermes Sandals and luck. Most parties will kill Grand Cross first to lower the number of dice rolls."
  - "Almagest is a HP check. Unless you have extreme damage output and rush it first, you will need the HP (or Shell) to survive it."
  - "You can skip enrage either by counting HP and killing the last 2 parts at the same time."
  - "...or you can save the bottom, non-Heavy part for last and then gib it with a Magic Lamp Odin."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Even without !white, you get one free Shell casting from the Wonder Wand, if you have it."
  Berserker:
  - "In the SNES version, there are 'dummy' targets in the fight that will cause your zerker to miss a lot."
  - "You will probably be better served equipping the Earth Hammer and any magic-boosting abilities you have."
  - "In the GBA/iOS version the dummies are gone, making the Rune Axe much more reliable."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Congratulations! Your Mystic Knight don't care about almagest."
  - "Break Blade will knock out the part that casts it with 100% accuracy."
  Time-Mage:
  - "If things go seriously south, the Time Mage's Quick is a good recovery tool."
  - "Quick will allow you to throw out multiple Phoenix Downs/Remedies/Elixirs in a single action."
  - "Meteor will be weaker than expected, due to the presence of two 'decoy' targets in the SNES version."
  Dragoon:
  - "Almagest is telegraphed by 'The Laws of the Universe Mean Nothing!'"
  - "Your dragoon can dodge that (and Grand Cross) by being in the air at that time."
  Dancer:
  - "You'll probably have to look elsewhere for damage, but Equip Ribbons make Grand Cross a nonissue."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can do excellent AoE by spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water)."
  - "It does damage equal to your HP, which is affected by the doubling from Giant's Drink"
  - "Between Giant's Drinks and the ability to Shell allies, Chemists can neuter Almagest."
  - "The Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) also grants immunity from most but not all Grand Cross outcomes." 
  Samurai:
  - "You will need an obscene amount of cash to kill NED with just !GilToss but it's conceptually simple."
  - "If you have a way to kill them, the Movers in the last room of the void drop huge piles of gil."
  Thief:
  - "Remember that weapons you steal off of NED's parts can be equipped mid-battle."
  UNION Thief Ninja:
  - "...or thrown, with your Ninja."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release a Dragon Aevis for a 9999-all-target Breath Wing. 4 of them will get NED's parts real low."
  - "You can also release a Crystelle for Mighty Guard to trivialize Almagest, but catching one's a horrible pain."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Mighty Guard and White Wind allow you to win stand-up brawls against NED with little fuss."
  - "Or you could abuse Dark Spark and L5 Death, but honestly I'd go with the first idea."
  Dragoon`:
  - "The Dragon Lance is super-effective vs. the Grand Cross part, if you're burning that one first."
  Bard:
  - "Apollo's Harp will do massive damage vs. the Grand Cross part, if for some reason your party isn't 99 speed/level 255 anyway."
  Ranger:
  - "Were you dumb enough to grind out a Dark Bow in Ronka? Congratulations!"
  - "The Melee piece (the one that chucks out 1800 damage Vacuum Waves) can be blinded!"
  - "NED's phantom targets will make !X-Fight less powerful on the SNES version, though."
  Summoner:
  - "An actual !summoned Odin will not work on the bottom part!"
  - "Hardcasted Odins will use Gungnir if any enemy on the field is Heavy."
