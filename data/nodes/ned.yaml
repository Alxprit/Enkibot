  Generic:
  - "Image guide: http://i.imgur.com/FphWf.gif"
  - "High level strategy overview follows:"
  - "Biggest threats are: Grand Cross (random aliments), Almagest (1620-1665 holy damage + sap), enrage (last part spams super attacks 2x/turn)"
  - "Grand Cross is mitigatable with Hermes Sandals and luck. Most parties will kill Grand Cross first to lower the number of dice rolls."
  - "Almagest is a HP check. Unless you have extreme damage output and rush it first, you will need the HP (or Shell) to survive it."
  - "You can skip enrage either by counting HP and killing the last 2 parts at the same time..."
  - "...or you can save the bottom, non-Heavy part for last and then gib it with a Magic Lamp Odin."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Even without !white, you get one free Shell casting from the Wonder Wand, if you have it."
  Berserker:
  - "In the SNES version, there are 'dummy' targets in the fight that will cause your zerker to miss a lot."
  - "You will probably be better served equipping the Earth Hammer and any magic-boosting abilities you have."
  - "In the GBA/iOS version the dummies are gone, making the Rune Axe much more reliable."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Congratulations! Your Mystic Knight don't care about almagest."
  - "Break Blade will knock out the part that casts it with 100% accuracy."
  Time-Mage:
  - "If things go seriously south, the Time Mage's Quick is a good recovery tool."
  - "Quick will allow you to throw out multiple Phoenix Downs/Remedies/Elixirs in a single action."
  - "Meteor will be weaker than expected, due to the presence of two 'decoy' targets in the SNES version."
  - "If you're a gambling sort, you can try to land Old on the Almagest part at *extremely* low odds. It'll completely defang that piece, though."
  - "You can also, with even more gambling (and high levels) involved, attempt to Banish the far-left piece. Not very practical, but absolutely hilarious."
  Dragoon:
  - "The Dragon Lance is super-effective vs. the Grand Cross part, if you're burning that one first."
  - "Almagest is telegraphed by Neo Exdeath beginning to shake, and Grand Cross is telegraphed by the warning 'The laws of the universe mean nothing!'."
  - "Your dragoon can dodge them by being in the air at that time."
  Dancer:
  - "You'll probably have to look elsewhere for damage, but Equip Ribbons make Grand Cross a nonissue."
  - "That said, the Man-Eater deals critical damage to the left-most piece (the one that casts magic and is killed by Odin)."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can do excellent AoE by spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water)."
  - "It does damage equal to your HP, which is affected by the doubling from Giant's Drink"
  - "Between Giant's Drinks and the ability to Shell allies, Chemists can neuter Almagest."
  - "The Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) also grants immunity from Grand Cross' Hp-to-Critical result." 
  Samurai:
  - "You will need an obscene amount of cash to kill NED with just !GilToss but it's conceptually simple."
  - "If you have a way to kill them, the Movers in the last room of the void drop huge piles of gil."
  Thief:
  - "Remember that weapons you steal off of NED's parts can be equipped mid-battle."
  UNION Thief Ninja:
  - "...or thrown, with your Ninja."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters can release a Dragon Aevis for a 9999-all-target Breath Wing. 4 of them will get NED's parts real low."
  - "You can also release a Crystelle for Mighty Guard to trivialize Almagest, but catching one's a horrible pain."
  - "As long as you're under level 45, using the Dancing Dagger in the back row against a Crystelle that you !Control to use Protect does 1-3 or 2-6 damage (if you don't !Dance)."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Mighty Guard and White Wind allow you to win stand-up brawls against NED with little fuss."
  - "Or you could abuse Dark Spark and L5 Death, but honestly I'd go with the first idea."
  UNION Blue-Mage Chemist:
  - "Unless you have mix AND math at your side, which lets you set up the hilarious QUAD SKULL."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "Condemn/Doom works on the far-left piece, if you don't want to just Magic Lamp it, or if you think that telling the final boss it has 30 seconds to live is hilarious (it is)."
  Bard:
  - "Apollo's Harp will do massive damage vs. the Grand Cross part, if for some reason your party isn't 99 speed/level 255 anyway."
  Ranger:
  - "Were you dumb enough to grind out a Dark Bow in Ronka, or bought one in Bal? Congratulations!"
  - "The Melee piece (the one that chucks out 1800 damage Vacuum Waves) can be blinded!"
  - "NED's phantom targets will make !X-Fight less powerful on the SNES version, though."
  Summoner:
  - "An actual !summoned Odin will not work on the bottom part!"
  - "Hardcasted Odins will use Gungnir if any enemy on the field is Heavy."
  - "Boosted Syldras can probably end this fight before it really begins. Load !Summon and Air Knives on everyone."
  Ninja:
  - "Scrolls are still good AoE, and you can throw some of those legendary weapons you aren't using for good single-target damage. Fuma Shurikens will be stronger though, if you bought/found a bunch."
  Geomancer:
  - "!Gaia will always use Wind Slash here. Boost it with Air Knife or Rune Chime, and it'll do honestly pretty impressive target-all damage."
  Monk:
  - "Unless you did a lot of grinding, your fists won't do much here. Just settle for making them an elixir dispensary, or give them some other class's secondary."
  - "HP +30% can make it easier for your other classes to survive Almagest, though."
  White-Mage:
  - "Shell makes Almagest a non-issue. Blink does the same for the physicals."
  INTERSECTION Summoner Black-Mage:
  - "If you're having trouble killing the Almagest piece before it kills you, you can attempt (at fairly low odds) to Break/Catoblepas it."
  Black-Mage:
  - "AoE damage makes it pretty easy to kill the last two parts at the same time."
  - "If you go with this method, though, keep in mind that the far right piece has 5000 less HP than the middle pieces, and the far left piece has 5000 more."
  Red-Mage:
  - "At least you can put up Protects...?"
  - "Raise+Cura isn't the *worst* use of their time, though you're probably better off just breaking rods for middling damage."
  - "Hopefully you have another class that can use Dualcast and can pick up the slack."
