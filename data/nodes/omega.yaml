    - calofisteri
  Generic:
  - "Optional superboss; there is no reason other than bragging rights to try this."
  - "To pull this off at a sane level, you need both a way to neuter his offense and a way to actually hurt him."

  Generic`:
  - "Without cheese but with good sandbagging classes like WHM or BLU, you can try to fight it out normally."

  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can mix a Split Shell/Turtle Soup to decrease Omega's defense and magic defense."
  Ranger:
