Minotauros + Omniscient:
  Metadata:
    next-node: sea_trench
    previous-nodes:
    - fork_tower
  Generic:
  - Dual boss; you have to split up your parties for this.
  - Minotaur is easy even for mages. Just whittle him down with Chicken Knife and potions.
  - Just don't be afraid to back off on dps, since he counters with more physical attacks.
  - Omniscient Resets if a physical command is used on him, unless silenced or berserked.
  - SILENCE AND BERSERK DO NOT WORK IN THE STEAM/MOBILE VERSION DO NOT BLAME ME IF YOU DO NOT READ THIS
  - His entire offense is neutralized by Reflect Rings, but you still need a way to kill him.
  White-Mage:
  - White Mages can simply land Berserk on him and then spam Blink.
  - The latter bit is important, he hits like a freight train loaded with bricks.

  Chemist:
  - Offensive mixes will cause Omniscient to reset the battle.
  - That said, you can just berserk + blind him trivially.
  Mystic-Knight:
  - Silence Blade is hilariously effective.
  Break-Rods:
  - SNAPPING RODS COUNTS AS A PHYSICAL ATTACK (somehow).
  Generic`:
  - The Magic Lamp is, unfortunately, a physical attack.
  - Failing any other way to do this, there are three general strategies.
  - 1) With Reflect Ring+Mage Masher reflect Silence onto Omniscient by attacking yourself.
  - 2) With a Reflect Ring+Bone Mail, just wait for him to impale himself on yourself.
  - 3) With a Reflect Ring, wait out his 30,000 MP. This may happen before (2) does.
  - ps if you do this route, mage masher him then hit him with an ether to overflow his mp straight down to 9999.
  - All of these options are Super Bullshit 64 and you should seriously consider if you need to do Fork Tower at all.
  - Also, none of them work on the mobile or Steam releases.
  - Those versions *do* allow rod breaking and lamp use.
