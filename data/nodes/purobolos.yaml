Purobolos:
  Metadata:
    next-node: titan
    previous-nodes: ['archaeoavis']
  Generic:
    - "1500 HP, cast Exploder when low, will cast Life2 to revive other puroboloses when killed."
    - "Easiest way to handle this is brute force with powerful AOEs to kill them all at once."
  Break-Rods:
    - "Yup, that means rods."
  NOT Break-Rods:
    - "Otherwise, whittle them down one-by-one to make them Explode; they won't Life2 when they do this."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "If you don't want to just spam rods, Aqua Rake works pretty great here too."
    - "So does Death Claw, which will make all their explosions do single-digit damage."
  Samurai:
    - "Just kill them all with one gil tosses, though that's expensive. Maybe do something else if you have the option."
  Ninja:
    - "Spamming a few scrolls on them, especially with a mage subability, will make quick work this fight."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Beastmasters have it super-easy here: they can just !Control the bombs and have them Exploder each other."
    - "Or if that takes two long, !Releasing two Prototypes will end the fight instantly."
  White-Mage:
    - "A Silenced Purobolos will not cast Life2 upon death."
  Mystic-Knight:
    - "A Silence Bladed Purobolos will not cast Life2 upon death."
  Time-Mage:
    - "The Time Mage's Mute spell will not stop Life2 from going off."
    - "Gravity will cut their HP enough to make Exploder managable, however."
  Bard:
    - "A Purobolos that's Stopped by !Sing will not cast Life2 upon death."
  Berserker:
    - "This is another fight you might want to come in with a dead/blinded berserker for."
    - "If that's not an option (QUADZERK), you can roll the dice on Mage Masers to silence them with."
