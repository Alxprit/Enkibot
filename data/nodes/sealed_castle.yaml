  Generic:
  - "You'll have the choice of 3 legendary weapons at first in the Sealed Castle, plus 3 more per tablet."
  - "The Assassin's Dagger is the only really multiclass one, but it's real good (bring it to cheese twintania)."
  Knight: 
  - "Excalibur has the highest Power of any easily obtainable weapon and is Holy elemental. No-brainer for Knights." 
  Ninja:
  - "The Hardened Dagger is really good, espeically if your Ninja isn't your Chicken Knife user."
  Dragoon:
  - "The Holy Lance is a solid option for your dragoon, though dragoon is kind of a falling-off class at this point."
  Berserker:
  - "The Rune Axe is kind of a mediocre choice for your Zerker...unless you have a magic-using seconary ability."
  Samurai:
  - "Masamune is dumb dumb dumb. Guaranteed initiative + use item for haste. Especially funny with !Flee or !Smoke. Get it."
  Ranger:
  - "Yoichi's Bow's selling point is the defense ignoring proc, but...aren't you using !x-fight?"
  - "In fact, aren't you just using the chicken knife with it?"
  Bard:
  - "Apollo's harp is kind of niche, but it's not a bad choice for your third tablet if you have no better options."
  UNION Bard Chemist:
  - "Chemists have the ability to turn things into dragons so Apollo's Harp can wreck them, which is at least funny if not practical."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Any rod-using class can equip the Wizard Rod, but it's best on Black/Red Mages because of its omni-elemental boosts."
  - "(Summoners prefer the Air Lancet to boost Syldra)."
  Staff:
  - "Very few staff-using classes have a use for the Sage's Staff, frankly."
  Chemist:
  - "Though the Sage's Staff lets you butcher the Exdeath Souls right outside for Dark Matter (assuming the Pyramid was too rough)."
  Beastmaster:
  - "The Firebute is basically garbage, though it out-performs the other two end-game whips if they're not hitting a monster-type weakness."
  Geomancer:
  - "The Gaia Bell is actually garbage."
