  Generic:
  - "The Barrier Tower is a fairly obnoxious dungeon with a lot of loot you want to grab."
  - "Anyone with a caster should make sure to get the Gold Hairpin in a guarded chest on the left side of Floor 9, which halves MP consumption."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can learn Time Slip from Travelers, though it's of somewhat limited utility."
  - "Level Trickers can cast Level 4 Graviga here, if you missed it from Ronka."
  Knight:
  - "Knights can obtain the Blood Sword here, a weapon which drains HP from its target."
  - "Note that it's nearly useless since it only has 25% Accuracy, AND is treated like a magic spell in damage calculations."
  Thief:
  - "Thieves can steal a Flame Ring from the Red Dragons in the Gold Hairpin and Blood Sword chests."
  - "Remember, you can flee from a monster-in-a-box to reset the encounter if your steal fails."
  - "...or if you're a nutter and want 4 of them."
  - "...or if you want even more to sell for gil, all while grinding out escapes for the Chicken Knife."
  Generic`:
  - "Most importantly, farm Reflect Knights for their Reflect Ring drops here."
  - "Unless you have a way to cheese him entirely, you'll need them for World 2 Exdeath."
  - "The best place to farm them is outside between floors 5 and 6, but if you need to return to the sub to heal frequently the balcony between 3 and 4 is pretty good too."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Drain bypasses Reflect, so you can farm your first Reflect Ring with Drain and then bounce Breaks off your own party for the rest."
