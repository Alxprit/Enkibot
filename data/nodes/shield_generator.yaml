  Generic:
  - "The Barrier Tower is a fairly obnoxious dungeon with a lot of loot you want to grab."
  - "Anyone with a caster should make sure to get the Gold Hairpin, which halves MP consumption."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can learn Time Slip from Travelers, though it's of somewhat limited utility."
  - "Level Trickers can cast Level 4 Graviga here, if you missed it from Ronka."
  Knight:
  - "Knights can obtain the Blood Sword here, a weapon which drains HP from its target."
  - "Note that it's nearly useless since it only has 25% Accuracy, AND is treated like a magic spell for Multipler calculations."
  Thief:
  - "Thieves can get an invaluable Flame Ring from the Red Dragons in trapped chests."
  - "You can flee from a monster-in-a-box to reset the encounter if your steal fails."
  - "...or if you're a nutter and want 4 of them."
  - "...or as many as you want to sell for gil while grinding out flees for the Chicken Knife."
  Generic`:
  - "Most importantly, farm Reflect Knights for their Reflect Ring drop here."
  - "Unless you have a way to cheese him entirely, you'll need them for World 2 Exdeath."
