    - voidamesh
  Generic:
  - "Optional superboss; there is no reason other than bragging rights to try this."
  - "Generally a lot more possible than Omega - you can hurt him with a lot, so the only question is not dying."
  - "Coral Rings to absorb his opening Tidal Waves are usually a must - unless you are Berserking him, as every job but Berserker can outrace said Tidal Wave while hasted."
  Beastmaster:
  - "If you want his Dragon Whisker for your Beastmaster, remember that you can run from Shinryu."
  - "There's nothing stopping you from !Stealing (or Thief Knifing) and running repeatedly."
  - "Except basic common sense, i guess."
  Generic`:
  - "The vast majority of easy Shinryu kills are going to involve Berserking him."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Exception: Quick + Venom Rod works just fine for Time Mages, if you have the patience."
  White-Mage:
  - "Anyone with White Magic can simply cast Berserk on him, of course."
  - "White Mages have access to the Blink spell as well."
  Break-Rods:
  - "Anyone who can use a Rod can (eventually) land Berserk on him with the Wonder Rod."
  Staff:
  - "Staff-users can attack with the Power Staff and apply a Berserk proc."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can mix Holy Water + Turtle Shell for a guaranteed Berserk."
  Generic``:
  - "You also need some way of surviving incredibly fast one-shot physical attacks."
  Shield:
  - "The Aegis Shield + mini status will boost a character's evasion % into the stratosphere."
  - "So will the Genji Shield from Gilgamesh in the Void, if you stole it. 99% Shield Evasion, baby!"
  Knight:
  - "Knights can coverscum Shinryu the same way they would vs. any other berserked enemy."
  Summoner:
  - "Summoners can just about keep up with Shinryu's offense using the Golem spell."
  Ninja:
  - "If you give the Ninja's !Image command to everyone, that'll work just fine."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists can mix a 100% blind with Dragon Fang + Eye Drops because of course they can."
  Cannoneer:
  - "You can inflict both Berserk and Blind with your magic gun."
  - "Admittedly, you're using up one of the 3ish Ash in the game to do so. Maybe take a picture but don't save to keep the Ragnarok."
  Generic```:
  - "In the worst case scenario, any class which can wear the Mirage Vest can abuse a GBA bug."
  - "On GBA, changing weapons with a Mirage Vest equipped will refresh its start-of-battle Blink."
  - "In the ACTUAL worst case scenario, if you bring enough Phoenix Downs, you don't really need to survive the punches."
  Staff:
  - "All Staff users have the Sage's Staff to help mitigate Phoenix Down usage, even without true Raise access."
