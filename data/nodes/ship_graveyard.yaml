  Generic:
    - "If you're feeling the pain w.r.t healing, the Calcruthls in here rarely drop Elixirs."
  White-Mage:
    - "The enemies here are Undead, which makes this a great place to gain levels with your White Mages."
    - "Make sure you pick up the hidden Flail; White Mage parties will rely on it for damage for a while."
  Thief:
    - "The Daggers dropped by skeleton enemies here are a nice upgrade from Knives; get four before fighting Siren."
