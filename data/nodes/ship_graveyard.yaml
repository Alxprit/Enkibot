  Generic:
    - "If you're feeling the pain w.r.t healing, the Calcruthls in here rarely drop Elixirs."
    - "The room with the three treasure chests after the save point is the best place to grind those if you need."
    - "Don't forget, if you need to grind for any reason, you can sleep below decks on Faris' ship(wreck)."
  White-Mage:
    - "The enemies here are Undead, which makes this a great place to gain levels with your White Mages."
    - "Make sure you pick up the hidden Flail; White Mage parties will rely on it for damage for a while. It's south of where you start."
  Thief:
    - "The Daggers dropped by skeleton enemies here are the only way to outfit your entire Thief party; get four before fighting Siren."
  Knight:
    - "Because they sometimes factor AGI in, the Daggers dropped by skeleton enemies here can be better than Broadswords. Probably not worth the time though."
  Ninja:
    - "If you expect to have trouble vs. Byblos, you can farm Fire Scrolls off the Psycho Heads here."
