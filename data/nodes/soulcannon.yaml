  Blue-Mage:
    - "The turrets you fight before SoulCannon can teach you Missile and Flamethrower/Burn Ray."
    - "The latter is a very solid damage option with a Flame Rod equipped."
  Generic:
    - "12500 HP; charges up and then casts Surge Beam (casts get faster after the first)"
    - "Surge beam deals 50% of the party's max HP and inflicts HP Leak."
    - "The real danger is the Launchers: 2 of 'em, 800 effective HP, can inflict Old."
    - "Try to kill the launchers fast with lightning damage to avoid having your whole party slowed into uselessness."
  Blue-Mage`:
    - "the launchers are level 50 so you can just L5 death em lmao"
  Break-Rods:
    - "It'll take two rods (of any flavor) to kill the launchers, unless you've been grinding."
  Summoner:
    - "Or just cast Ramuh, whatever."
  Ninja:
    - "Thunder scrolls work especially well."
  White-Mage:
    - "Parties with !white can get through this slowly by Esunaing the Olds and healing through Surge Beams."
    - "Esuna will not heal the stat downs incurred while Old'd! Purge the status effect IMMEDIATELY."
  NOT White-Mage:
    - "If your offense is slow, you may as a last resort buy Angel Rings from Istory at 50k each; they prevent Old."
  Geomancer:
    - "All you'll get in this fight is Wind Slash! Awesome! ...except Soul Cannon and the Launchers are immune to wind."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Stop from a Time Mage will work on the Launchers, if for some reason you're allergic to rod abuse."
  Bard:
    - "This is a surprisngly funny fight for Bards, since they can Stop the Launchers all at once and Hide from the Surge Beams."
  Beastmaster:
    - "You may be able to rush the Soulcannon down with four Bearagas (~9k damage) plus some chip."
    - "Alternate plan: you can Capture a Prototype and release it for ~1k all-target damage."
    - "Prototype is vulnerable to !Control, but actually reducing it to 1/8 hp is an exercise for the reader."
  Generic`:
    - "All damage in this fight is % based, so armor does nothing. Consider unequipping it for speed."
