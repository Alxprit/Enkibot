    previous-nodes: ['adamantoise']
  Generic:
    - "12500 HP; charges up and then casts Surge Beam (casts get faster over time)"
    - "Surge beam deals 50% of the party's max HP and inflicts HP Leak."
    - "The real danger is the Launchers: 4 of 'em, 800 effective HP, can inflict Old."
    - "Try to kill the launchers fast with lightning damage to avoid having your whole party slowed into uselessness."
  Break-Rods:
    - "hahaha you have rods just snap a Thunder Rod and kill all the launchers instantly."
  Summoner:
    - "Or just cast Ramuh, whatever."
  Ninja:
    - "Thunder scrolls work especially well."
  White-Mage:
    - "Parties with !white can get through this slowly by Esunaing the Olds and healing through Surge Beams."
  NOT White-Mage:
    - "If your offense is slow, you may as a last resort buy Angel Rings from Istory at 50k each; they prevent Old."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Stop from a Time Mage will work on the Launchers, if for some reason you're allergic to rod abuse."
  Bard:
    - "This is a surprisngly funny fight for Bards, since they can Stop the Launchers all at once and Hide from the Surge Beams."
  Beastmaster:
    - "There are several AoE releases--the good 'ol Breath Wing from Zus near Karnak come to mind--that can be used to kill Launchers."
    - "Alternatively, you may be able to rush the Soulcannon down with four Bearagas (~9k damage) plus some chip."
  Generic`:
    - "All damage in this fight is % based, so armor does nothing. Consider unequipping it for speed."
