    - sea_trench
  Generic:
  - "13333 HP each, primarily attack with not super dangerous black magic."
  - "The only real reason to fight these guys is if you have a Time Mage, for Meteor."
  - "They're Undead and not Heavy, so you can one-shot them with Phoenix Downs..."
  - "...but they'll revive each other, so you need to either stun then or use target-all."
  - "The easiest way to do this is to summon Odin from the Magic Lamp for a triple kill."
  Bard:
  - "The Bard's Requiem song is, as you might expect, completely disgusting here."
  White-Mage:
  - "Don't forget that White Mages can spam target-all Curagas on them."
  - "Or hit each one exactly once with a single-target Curaga, then finish them all of at once or something."
  Berserker:
  - "If you're going to fight it out, for the love of god kill/blind your berserker."
  Black-Mage:
  - "Be careful with group-cast black magic: each stooge absorbs the element he uses."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "If you can volley three off at once, you can kill them instantly with Break Blade."
