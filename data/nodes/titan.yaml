  Generic:
    - "2500 HP; main threat is the Earth Shakers he casts for powerful (480-540) all-target damage."
    - "He casts Earth Shaker on death, so you need to have a way to not wipe to that."
  INTERSECTION White-Mage Red-Mate:
    - "WHM/RDM can cast Confuse on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float, which neatly evades Earth Shaker."
  Dancer:
    - "Dancers can roll Tempting Tango on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float, to nullify Earth Shaker."
  UNION Thief Berserker:
    - "If you have a thief, a berserk, and a death wish, you can rarely steal a Earth Hammer from Titan."
    - "That's literally an endgame weapon, especially if you can back up its Quake procs with a mage subability."
  Chemist:
    - "Here's your introduction to the brokenness of !Mix: Antidote + Maiden's Kiss = Levisalve."
  Beastmaster:
    - "Stopping Titan with !Calm right before you kill him will dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight."
  Bard:
    - "Stopping Titan with !Sing right before you kill him will dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight."
  Time-Mage:
    - "Your Time Mage can set Slow on Titan, which helps with wearing him down before he gets too many shakers off."
    - "If you have no alternative, you can Stop Titan right before you kill him, but the timing is tight."
  Summoner:
    - "Titan is vulnerable to the Stop set by the Remora summon, probably the only time in the game it's useful."
    - "With very, very good timing, you may be able to avoid the last Earth Shaker using it."
  Generic`:
    - "Failing any way to scam Earth Shaker, the only real alternative is to have enough HP to survive it."
