    - necrophobe
  Generic:
  - "49001 HP. Starts with regular attacks and White Hole (petrify+death)."
  - "Adds Holy and Condemn below 30000, then Meteo below 10000. Rush that last 10K HP, Meteo hurts."
  - "Spawns Neo-Exdeath after going down."
  Bard:
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Bards can use the time to go capped-stats Super Saiyan now."
  - "White Hole can put a wrench in that plan--if you have the time to kill, you can !Hide until Exdeath runs out of mana."
  UNION Bard Blue-Mage:
  - "If you have Blue Mage in addition to Bard, Magic Hammers will drain Exdeath's MP a hell of a lot faster."
  Chemist:
  - "Yes, yes, on the SNES you can Kiss of Blessing to stop NED from spawning and thus skip the final boss. Gold star. Don't."
  - "This fight continues into NED, so Chemists can use the time to go immune-to-everything-level-255 Super Saiyan now."
  Shield:
  - "Aegis Shield blocks White Hole completely, so have it on your most indispensible character."
  White-Mage:
  - "Have Shell and Protect on the party going into Exdeath."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Mighty Guard. Mightguardmightyguardmightyguard. You can even facetank Meteos with it."
  - "Especially after you Dark Spark him once and land a Level 2 Old."
  Ninja:
  - "Now would probably be a good time to chuck all those legendary weapons, if you're having trouble burning the last 10K HP."
