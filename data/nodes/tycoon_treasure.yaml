Tycoon (optional):
  Metadata:
    next-node: garula
    previous-nodes: ['walse_tower']
  Generic:
    - "Check a world map to see how you can get back to Tycoon Castle early with the wind drake."
    - "The treasures are mostly healing items, including two Elixirs and three Cottages."
    - "Two of those Cottages are hidden - walk into the castle courtyard, but before going in head over to the right wall and walk through a passage behind a tower."
  Staff:
    - "You'll also get a Healing Staff, which casts Cura instead of attacking, and is great for most of the game."
  Samurai:
    - "You'll also get an Ashura katana, which is the first possible katana for samurai-havers."
  NOT Samurai:
    - "You'll also get an Ashura katana, which may be useful if you're in Chaos and have a Freelancer."
  Summoner:
    - "This is also a good time to head to the tower behind the waterfall in Walse to get Shiva."
    - "Most easily, crack a Fire Rod dropped in Walse Tower (you did farm an extra, right?) or buy one in Karnak and come back."
