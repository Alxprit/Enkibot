    previous-nodes:
    - lugor
  Generic:
  - "Let's get this out of the way. Objets d'Art in the basement of Val Castle drop very little XP, but lots of gil and AP."
  - "They can be instantly killed by the gold needle item."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can simply vaporize them with Level 5 Death, which makes grinding much less tedious."
  Ninja:
  - "Thunder Scrolls are quite effective."
  Thief:
  - "Thieves can rarely steal Twin Lances from them, which is the best weapon they'll get for a long time."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists are the only class that can equip the hidden Angel Robe in Val Castle."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Time Mages should get the Teleport spell in Val Castle; it's the only source of it in the game."
  INTERSECTION Knight Mystic-Knight:
  - "The Great Sword in the moat of Val Castle is the best sword you're gonna get for quite a while."
  Bard:
  - "You can pick up Requiem in Quelb, which damages undead monsters. Quite handy for the next area and many to come."
  Generic`:
  - "Drakenvale itself has some fantastic loot."
  - "The Dragon Zombies here are tough, but can be easily defeated by Phoenix Downs or other anti-undead measures."
  - "They always drop Dragon Fangs, which sell for 2500 gil each!"
  Chemist`:
  - "Dragon Fangs are also invaluable for endgame Chemist shenanigans; you'll want to grind a few of them."
  - "If you plan on killing Omega with your solo chemist, you'll want 40+."
  Beastmaster:
  - "Beastmasters should make sure they get the Coronet here, which doubles the success rate of !Control."
  Generic``:
  - "The big prize is the Bonemail, which you can find on a skeleton near the top of Drakenvale."
  - "It's a medium armor with sky-high physical defense and immunity to death, poison, old, charm, and berserk."
  - "It also makes most healing magic hurt (though instant death effects like Doom, Death Sickle procs, etc will now full heal you.)"
  - "You can also get around this with elemental absorb: flame rings are particularily good since Bonemail also confers fire weakness."
  Blue-Mage`:
  - "The Blue Mage's White Wind spell can still heal Bonemail wearers, because !Blue wasn't good enough."
  Mystic-Knight:
  - "Bonemail is particularily disgusting on a Mystic Knight with Drain Sword, which still works."
  Generic```:
  - "Bonemail is otherwise best against random encounters, bosses that mostly attack physically, or bosses that mostly use status spells."
