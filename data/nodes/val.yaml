  Generic:
  - "Let's get this out of the way. Objets d'Art in the basement of Val Castle drop 0 XP, but lots of gil and AP."
  - "They can be instantly killed by soft needles (or any other petrifaction cure)."
  Blue-Mage:
  - "Blue Mages can simply vaporize them with Level 5 Death, which makes grinding much less tedious."
  Chemist:
  - "Chemists are the only class that can equip the hidden Angel Robe in Val Castle."
  Time-Mage:
  - "Time Mages should get the Teleport spell in Val Castle; it's the only source of it in the game."
  Bard:
  - "Bards can get a Lamia Harp in Val Castle, which gives you a rather more reliable confusion source than the Dancing Dagger."
  UNION Knight Mystic-Knight:
  - "The Great Sword in the moat of Val Castle is the best sword you're gonna get for quite a while."
