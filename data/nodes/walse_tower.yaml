    next-node: tycoon_treasure
    previous-nodes: ['magissa']
  Generic:
    - "The waterfall behind Walse Castle has the Shiva fight, which is critical for Summoners."
    - "...but you won't have Summoner until after the next dungeon."
  Knight:
    - "You can buy Iron armor in Walse town, which isn't strictly necessary since you can cheese Garula easily with your Knight."
  Thief:
    - "Strongly consider the Kempo Gi armors from Walse town; you're gonna want every edge you can get for Garula."
    - "Please, please, please steal four mythril daggers from the Y-Burns (sorry, wyverns) in Walse Tower."
    - "Also, buy a fuckton of potions. Sorry, Garula just sucks for thieves."
  Blue-Mage:
    - "In the waterfall behind Walse Castle, you can learn Frog Song. Not only is it very good vs. Garula, it's a generally nice spell to have."
  Thief`:
    - "Thieves have a fairly easy time getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle. It's nice vs. Garula."
  NOT Thief:
    - "You probably don't want to bother with getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle, unless you're willing to abuse the Quicksave glitch in the GBA version."
  Break-Rods:
    - "The RicardMages in Walse Tower can drop Flame Rods, if you snapped the free Frost Wand on Magissa and want to trivialize Garula."
