WARNING: unexpected node transition chocobo_forest => sandwormWARNING: unexpected node transition bearaga => crayclaw## Wing Raptor
* [Generic] "Cloud, attack while its tail is up!"
* [Blue-Mage] Don't forget to learn Goblin Punch, Aero, Vampire, and Flash.

## Post-Wind Shrine
* [Generic] Most classes will not need to purchase gear here to beat Karlabos, but it's cheap.
* [Beastmaster] If you plan on releasing it against the Antlion, don't open the trapped chest in the Training House.
* [Bard] There's a piano here, for parties with bards.

## Karlabos
* [Generic] 650 HP; can inflict paralysis or lower a character to 1 HP. Basically the worst for solo games.
* [Generic] Just Potion up after getting hit by Tail Screw and you'll be fine.
* [Black-Mage] Black Mages can absolutely wreck him with Thunder, which he's weak to.
* [White-Mage] If you're stuck with four White Mages, you'll probably need to grind out another point of M at level 8.
* [Thief] Thief gets more points of M at levels 5 and 11. You may need to grind it out, or spend an inordinate amount of potions.

## Ship Graveyard
* [Generic] If you're feeling the pain w.r.t healing, the Calcruthls in here rarely drop Elixirs.
* [Generic] Don't forget, if you need to grind for any reason, you can sleep below decks on Faris' ship(wreck).
* [White-Mage] The enemies here are Undead, which makes this a great place to gain levels with your White Mages.
* [White-Mage] Make sure you pick up the hidden Flail; White Mage parties will rely on it for damage for a while.
* [Thief] The Daggers dropped by skeleton enemies here are a nice upgrade from Knives; get four before fighting Siren.

## Siren
* [Generic] 900 HP; switches between a high-MDEF human form and a high-PDEF undead form.
* [Generic] She has the heavy flag, so no getting cheeky with Phoenix Downs (which are expensive rn anyway)
* [NOT White-Mage] Even without !white, you can damage the undead form for 50 HP a shot with Potions.
* [White-Mage] You can use Cure to deal big damage to her undead form.
* [White-Mage] The Flail ignores defense, which means you can actually also do some pretty nice damage to her human form.
* [White-Mage] Remember that the Flail can be used from the back row at 100% damage.
* [Black-Mage] lol just nuke her with fire.
* [Blue-Mage] Don't try to use Vampire on her Undead form; the results are as predictable as they are unfortunate.
* [Monk] Fist criticals can penetrate Siren's hefty physical defense even in undead form.

## Kerwin/North Mountain
* [Generic] You don't care about it now, but unless you have Blue/Time, confused gaelicats on North Mountain are your only way to get Float.
* [Break-Rods] The hidden Frost Rod in Kerwin lets you trivialize either Magissa or Garula, so get it.
* [White-Mage] Pick up Armor/Protect in the Kerwin magic shop. Trust me on this one.
* [Bard] There's a piano here in Kerwin, too.
* [Knight] Optionally, get the heavy armor from the armor shop in Kewin; it's a nice upgrade.
* [Blue-Mage] If you restore their MP with Ether, you can learn Flash from the tombstone enemies in North Mountain.
* [Blue-Mage] I'm not actually sure it's worth it, frankly.

## Magissa + Forza
* [Generic] 650 HP; alternates between black magic and drain/fight. Summons Forza at 300 HP.
* [Generic] Forza has 850 HP and can easily one-shot a squishy character in the front row.
* [White-Mage] It's technically quite easy to sandbag your way through Magissa's 200 MP before she summons Forza, if you have !White.
* [Thief] Just bring a lot of potions if you have 4 thieves. There's no real way to finesse this fight.
* [Thief] If you're really in trouble, grind to level 16. With 4 Daggers, you can bring Magissa from 320 to dead in one set of !Fights.
* [Break-Rods] You can snap the Frost Rod from Kerwin here for dumb amounts of damage; pushing Magissa from 300-0 like that skips Forza.
* [Blue-Mage] Okay, this is like the one time in the game where Flash actually is really good: you can blind Forza easily.
* [Black-Mage] If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, you can also just Sleep Forza and unload on Magissa.

## Walse/Walse Tower
* [Knight] You can buy Iron armor in Walse town, which isn't strictly necessary since you can cheese Garula easily with your Knight.
* [Thief] Strongly consider the Kempo Gi armors from Walse town; you're gonna want every edge you can get for Garula.
* [Thief] Please, please, please steal four mythril daggers from the Y-Burns (sorry, wyverns) in Walse Tower.
* [Thief] Also, buy a fuckton of potions. Sorry, Garula just sucks for thieves.
* [Blue-Mage] In the waterfall behind Walse Castle, you can learn Frog Song. Not only is it very good vs. Garula, it's a generally nice spell to have.
* [Thief] Thieves have a fairly easy time getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle. It's nice vs. Garula.
* [NOT Thief] You probably don't want to bother with getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle, unless you're willing to abuse the Quicksave glitch in the GBA version.
* [Break-Rods] The RicardMages in Walse Tower can drop Flame Rods, if you snapped the free Frost Wand on Magissa and want to trivialize Garula.

## Garula
* [Generic] 1200 HP, begins countering every attack with Rush at 800 HP.
* [Generic] A definite trainwreck waiting to happen for unlucky and unprepared players.
* [Break-Rods] Of course, you could pretty much just toast him with one snapped rod farmed from a RicardMage downstairs.
* [Knight] Knights can cheese this fight hilariously with three critical-HP characters and one spamming Cover.
* [Knight] Garula can't do anything to you, it's hysterical.
* [Knight] Well, OK, he can still inflict HP Sap. Bring a few potions or something.
* [White-Mage] White Mages can cast Protect to make Garula's offense half as dangerous.
* [White-Mage] For 4x WHM parties: put everyone in the back row and ONLY attack with the Flail to minimize counterattacks.
* [White-Mage] It's easy enough to grind out. Also completely infuriating.
* [Thief] 4x Thief parties should have a mythril knife attacker in the front row and 3 potion chuckers in the back row.
* [Thief] Seriously expect to burn through 50-60+ potions if you're at a reasonable level and haven't been grinding.
* [Monk] The Monk's !Focus, which lets you hit twice as hard half as often, completely trivializes the counterattack mechanic.
* [Blue-Mage] You can get Frog Song to apply to Garula. He can cure himself, but he'll keep wasting turns.
* [Blue-Mage] Garula can't counterattack while frogged, either.
* [Blue-Mage] Blind will also stick to him, if for some reason frog abuse isn't enough.

## Tycoon (optional)
* [Generic] Check a world map to see how you can get back to Tycoon Castle early with the ship.
* [Generic] Treasure includes valuable healing items, such as multiple Elixirs.
* [Staff] You'll also get a Healing Staff, which casts Cura instead of attacking, and is totally amazing.
* [Samurai] You'll also get an Ashura katana, which is the first possible katana for samurai-havers.
* [NOT Samurai] You'll also get an Ashura katana, which may be useful if you're in Chaos and have a Freelancer.
* [Summoner] This is also a good time to head to the tower behind the waterfall in Walse to get Shiva.
* [Summoner] Worst case scenario, use a Fire Rod from Walse Tower (you did farm an extra, right?) or buy one in Karnak and come back.

## Fireship
* [Generic] You'll only get one discounted item at a Karnak store, so pick a pricey one.
* [Generic] Wild Nakks outside of Karnak are probably the easiest way to farm cash in world 1.
* [Break-Rods] This is especially nice since Karnak is the only source of rods in the world.
* [Break-Rods] Consider stocking up before going to the Fireship; rods make the Karnak 500 so much easier.
* [Bard] The third piano is also in Karnak, so make sure you get that for your bard.
* [Black-Mage] The magic store here sells level 3 black magic.
* [White-Mage] The magic store here sells Cura and Raise.
* [Time-Mage] The magic store here sells Stop and Gravity.
* [Generic] After some plot business, you'll be sent off to the next dungeon: the Fire Ship.
* [Blue-Mage] Crew Dusts in the Fire Ship cast Flash, which you can pick up for your Blue Mage.
* [INTERSECTION Thief Ninja] Thieves and Ninjas should make sure they get the Moonring Blade.
* [Thief] Thieves should also pick up the Thief's Gloves, which boost steal rate.

## Liquiflame
* [Generic] 3000 HP, transitions randomly between three forms when struck.
* [Generic] Human Form: single and multi target attacks and counters with target-all fire magic.
* [Generic] Hand Form: single target attacks that can paralyze and counters with Fire 2. IMMUNE TO MAGIC.
* [Generic] Tornado Form: casts Fire2 on self to heal.
* [Ranger] Consider killing it in Tornado Form to get the Fire Bow.
* [NOT Ranger] If you don't know whether you'll have ranger yet, consider killing it in Tornado Form to get the Fire Bow.
* [Break-Rods] Frost Rods will, of course, completely trash this guy. Do not use them when it's in hand form!
* [Monk] Fewer, bigger hits will do better against him, so !Focus ain't bad here.
* [Knight] The fewer times you have to hit liquidflame the fewer counters you see; consider using Two-Handed.
* [Mystic-Knight] Blizzara Sword up and just wreck this dude. Make sure you have a way to transform hand form, though.
* [Generic] Since the forms' MP is tracked seperately and the tornado cannot actually hurt you, consider just sitting there until it's out. It won't take long.
* [Berserker] Consider just having your Berserker blinded/dead as you enter the fight, until you run Tornado out of MP.

## The Karnak 500
* [Generic] You have 10:00 to get as much loot out of the Karnak 500 as possible.
* [Generic] Have your jobs and abilities set immediately after you kill liquiflame; the Karnak 500 continues ticking in menu.
* [Generic] It's best to look up a map if this is your first time. There's a decent one on GameFAQs.
* [Knight] RUN RUN RUN run. No, the Brave Blade ain't worth it. Never take the Brave Blade.
* [Thief] If your offense is good, you can steal plenty of Elixirs from the Gigas enemies infesting this place.
* [Generic] Try and get the Elven Mantle and Main Gauche; those are the best unconditional loot in here.
* [Dancer] There's also a Ribbon! Get the Ribbon! You'll need it for your Dancer! It's rad!
* [NOT Dancer] You could let the Ribbon burn _i guess_ if you're an idiot who deserves nothing except endless geomancers and red mages...
* [Blue-Mage] You can learn Aerora from the Gigases here for your Blue Mage, though it won't be too long until you can get it again.
* [White-Mage] White Mages should definitely not forget about the Esuna spell in a chest here; it'll be a while till you can rebuy it.
* [Generic] You'll have to kill Iron Claw, a miniboss with 900 HP and some adds, before you exit the castle.
* [Blue-Mage] He can teach you Death Claw, and you'd be well advised to try and get it here. It's lovely against anything that's not Heavy.
* [Blue-Mage] Don't kill the sergeant before he transforms into Death Claw, if you do decide to do this.
* [NOT Blue-Mage] Don't bother fighting it out. You can prevent him from spawning simply by killing the two dogs, then punching the sergeant until he runs.

## Library
* [Generic] On the walk down, dodge the desert unless you want to fight the powerful Dhorme Chimera.
* [Generic] Remember that you can heal for free in the Library by drinking from the pot on the second floor.
* [Chemist] The turtles infesting the grasslands around here drop Turtle Shells; you're gonna want to farm 99 of them for your Chemist.
* [Chemist] I know it sucks, but drain kiss is really really really good and you can basically run from everything else for the rest of the game.
* [Blue-Mage] Your Blue Mage should learn Level 5 Death from Page 32s in the library; you'll obviously have to grind to 15 or 20 for this.
* [Blue-Mage] You can also learn Moon Flute in here from Page 256s, but, uh, why?
* [UNION Blue-Mage Beastmaster] !Control will also let you learn Off-Guard from the same Page 256; this spell is marginally more useful.

## Ifrit
* [Generic] 3000 HP, alternates between (Fira or Flame) and (Fight or Flame)
* [Generic] 20% chance to evade all physicals, which can make some runs annoying.
* [Break-Rods] Snapping a couple of Frost Rods on him will put him down with minimal fuss.
* [INTERSECTION Black-Mage Red-Mage Summoner] So will simply blasting away with Ice-elemental attacks, if you're feeling cheap.
* [Ninja] Ifrit is weak to water in addition to ice, so here's a good place to use your water scroll.
* [Blue-Mage] Aqua Rake is actually nonaspected damge, so it won't be super-effective here.
* [Blue-Mage] He is, however, vulnerable to Blind and Berserk, both of which you can inflict by now with !Blue.
* [White-Mage] It's quite possible to land Silence on Ifrit, which cuts down on incoming damage significantly.
* [White-Mage] You can also berserk him, which could work out combined with back-row + protect spells.
* [Time-Mage] Ifrit is vulnerable to Slow, which you can inflict at this point with your Time Mage.
* [Beastmaster] Beastmasters can release Zus from the grassland outside Karnak, for a solid 750 damage each.

## Byblos
* [Generic] 3600 HP, uses a variety of debilitating spells which make prolonged engagements almost unwinnable.
* [Generic] He also can cast Protect on himself and will counter attacks with Drain when low.
* [Generic] That combination makes the fight brutal on parties with only physical damage.
* [Break-Rods] Happily, you can just snap a couple of Fire Rods over his head and call it a night.
* [Ninja] I hope you got that Flame Scroll from LiquiFlame if you don't have a better strategy for doing this!
* [Berserker] Zerker-heavy teams can have trouble here, because they can trigger Byblos' counters at bad times.
* [Berserker] If you have other powerful characters or a way to cheese the fight, consider coming in with your zerk blinded.
* [Summoner] Cast your new Ifrit summon on him for some extra comedy.
* [Blue Mage] Death Claw works on him, reducing him to single-digit HP immediately.
* [Blue Mage] He's not Heavy ahahahahaha.
* [Blue Mage] On the other hand, you probably want to learn Magic Hammer from him, which can be obnoxious as hell.
* [Beastmaster] A released Page 32 from the library will cast Banish, which has a 33% chance of straight up killing Byblos.

## Sailing
* [Generic] Black Mages, Summoners, and anyone with a use for the Istory rings can visit Istory at this point.
* [Generic] You can buy Angel Rings (block Old/Zombie) and elemental absorb rings for a cool 50K from Istory.
* [Bard] Bards can get the fourth Piano from Jachol, also.
* [Black-Mage] Black Mages can pick up the Toad spell from a NPC in the city.
* [Summoner] Summoners can learn Ramuh from an encounter outside the city.
* [Thief] Ramuh's common steal is a Hi-Potion and you won't get any other encounters outside Istory until you kill him.
* [Thief] You can steal Hi-Potions from him forever if you keep running from the fight.
* [Break-Rods] Rod-having parties can also pull the legendary Dragondarch Manuever outside Istory, farming the tough Magic Dragons there for XP.
* [Berserker] Berserker parties should swing by Crescent Island and farm up some Death Sickles from the Harvesters there.
* [INTERSECTION Summoner Ninja] Parties with reliable AoE magic, like !Summon or thrown scrolls, can farm a small island north of Crescent for XP and AP.
* [INTERSECTION Summoner Ninja] The only encounter there is 3 or 5 black flames, which have high avoid but can be cleared instantly by any AoE magic.
* [Beastmaster] If you're feeling up for it, !Control comedy will let you farm Prototypes on another island west of Crescent.
* [Beastmaster] It's pretty good gil and xp/ap.
* [UNION Chemist Beastmaster] ...especially since you have a Chemist, who can find a real use for the Dark Matters that the Prototyles drop.
* [Bard] Bards should make sure they grab the fifth piano from Crescent, while we're at it.

## Chocobo Forest
* [Generic] Pop by Rikks/Lix village now that you have black chocobo flight.
* [Generic] The item vendor there sells at half-price to you, making it a good place to stock up on ethers and phoenix downs.
* [Ninja] Ninjas will also appreciate buyable elemental scrolls and shuriken.

## Sandworm (Zerkersbane)
* [Generic] 3000 HP, can use Fight or Quicksand (~50 party damage and HP Sap).
* [Generic] Attacking the wrong hole triggers a counterattack.
* [Generic] The game tells you not to use magic here. The game is lying. Use magic.
* [Generic] Most non-Berserker parties can simply DPS race the sandworm with healing items.
* [Berserker] Yes, berserkers will repeatedly wipe your party here by being stupid. Kill or blind yours.
* [Berserker] If you're on zerker risk and have only berserkers, my condolences. Grind grind grind.
* [Blue-Mage] The Dhorme Chimera in the desert south of Karnak can teach you Aqua Rake, which will damn near one-shot the sandworm.
* [Beastmaster] The Dhorme Chimera in the desert south of Karnak casts Aqua Rake on release, which will damn near one-shot the sandworm.

## The Desert of Shifting Beastmasters

## Crayclaw
* [Generic] 2000 HP, uses various single-target attacks.
* [Generic] Signature combo is Tail Screwing someone who's under HP Leak, which will pretty much always kill them.
* [Generic] Basically any status effect will land on him, so it's easy to neuter his offense if you have to.
* [Generic] Low HP, but extremely high physical and magical defenses. Remember that elemental weaknesses (lightning) ignore MDEF.
* [Break-Rods] Yes, this is another fight you can trivialize with a rod snap or two.
* [Elemental] You can also simply blow him up with any other source of lightning damage.
* [INTERSECTION Knight Blue-Mage] You have a class which can wield the Coral Swords from Jacole, if you're willing to make the detour.
* [Ninja] You probably have some Thunder scrolls, since a common random encounter on the ocean drops them. Use 'em.
* [Ranger] The Thunder Bow purchasable in Crescent Town will make quick work of him.
* [Pierce-Def] Fists, katanas, x-fights, and other defense-piercing attacks will work if you have no other way through.
* [Thief] You can steal a Coral Sword from him if one of your other characters can wield a sword.

## Kyrosiris' Least Favorite Boss
* [Generic] The Adamantoise has 2000 HP, good magic evade, and sky-high physical defenses.
* [Generic] Has powerful physical attacks, which you'll want to scam with back-row + mitigation/status aliments.
* [Generic] The hard part is simply managing to get damge on this guy.
* [Break-Rods] Unless you can just snap a Frost Rod on him hahaha what's class balance?
* [Generic] Any source of Ice damage will bypass his defenses.
* [Ranger] Like, say, the Ice Bow you can buy in Crescent Town.
* [Blue-Mage] You can one-shot him instantly with Level 5 Death from your Blue Mage.
* [Beastmaster] He's not Heavy, so a Banish from a released Bandersnatch (near Walse) will have a 50/50 chance of killing him.
* [Berserker] He's not Heavy, so a proc'd Death spell from a Death Sickle axe hit will eventually get him.
* [Monk] Monk fist criticals will break through his physical defense. Eventually.
* [White-Mage] Blind is a godsend in this fight if you have to plink him down.
* [White-Mage] TECHNICALLY you can berserk or silence him too but...why?
* [Generic] The Something Awful Forusm >> Ask/Tell > [ASK] Me About Doing Adamantoise With Only Bards

## Soulcannon
* [Generic] 12500 HP; charges up and then casts Surge Beam (casts get faster over time)
* [Generic] Surge beam deals 50% of the party's max HP and inflicts HP Leak.
* [Generic] The real danger is the Launchers: 4 of 'em, 800 effective HP, can inflict Old.
* [Generic] Try to kill the launchers fast with lightning damage to avoid having your whole party slowed into uselessness.
* [Break-Rods] hahaha you have rods just snap a Thunder Rod and kill all the launchers instantly.
* [Summoner] Or just cast Ramuh, whatever.
* [Ninja] Thunder scrolls work especially well.
* [White-Mage] Parties with !white can get through this slowly by Esunaing the Olds and healing through Surge Beams.
* [NOT White-Mage] If your offense is slow, you may as a last resort buy Angel Rings from Istory at 50k each; they prevent Old.
* [Time-Mage] Stop from a Time Mage will work on the Launchers, if for some reason you're allergic to rod abuse.
* [Bard] This is a surprisngly funny fight for Bards, since they can Stop the Launchers all at once and Hide from the Surge Beams.
* [Beastmaster] There are several AoE releases--the good 'ol Breath Wing from Zus near Karnak come to mind--that can be used to kill Launchers.
* [Beastmaster] Alternatively, you may be able to rush the Soulcannon down with four Bearagas (~9k damage) plus some chip.
* [Generic] All damage in this fight is % based, so armor does nothing. Consider unequipping it for speed.

## Ronka Ruins
* [Generic] Don't hit the speed trap!
* [UNION Dancer Thief] Dance + Thief parties should steal a Lamia's Tiara from Lamias here, which boosts Sword Dance's proc rate.
* [Blue-Mage] If you missed it, the Enchanted Fan can teach you Aera.
* [UNION Beastmaster Blue-Mage] A !Controlled enchanted fan will also teach you White Wind, which is KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
* [UNION Beastmaster Blue-Mage] You can also learn 1000 Needles from !Controlled Lamias, which is pretty handy now or then.
* [UNION Beastmaster Inflict-Confuse] You can Confuse an enchanted fan to learn White Wind, which you really should since it's rad.
* [Blue-Mage] Frankly it's garbage and a pain in the ass to learn, but you can hunt down the Ghidra to learn Graviga at this point too.

## ArchaeoAvis
* [Generic] Has 5 forms with their own HP pool but shared MP pool.
* [Generic] F1: 1600 HP, weak to wind, high physical defense, inflicts Sap.
* [Generic] F2: 1600 HP, absorbs ice, not Heavy, inflicts poison.
* [Generic] F3: 1600 HP, absorbs fire, inflicts blind.
* [Generic] F4: 1600 HP, absorbs lightning, not Heavy, inflicts paralysis.
* [Generic] F5: 2500 HP, absorbs wind+ice+fire+lightning, has previous attacks and charm.
* [Generic] Magic-heavy teams may have to knife the last form to death painfully and slowly.
* [Time-Mage] You can land Slows on problem forms, if you feel like it.
* [Blue-Mage] Aerora the first form to death.
* [Blue-Mage] You can L5 Death the last form and the last form only, but that's the hard one anyway.
* [Blue-Mage] Hint: Death Claw will land on forms 2 and 4, so you only have to have an answer for F3.
* [Blue-Mage] God, blue mage is broken.
* [Geomancer] The first form is, like, geomancer's one time to shine. Go for it!!!
* [Summoner] Chocobo, your time is now! (It does physical damage and therefore will work on form 5).
* [Summoner] Unless you're on iOS hahaha fuck you they 'fixed' that.
* [Beastmaster] You can use Bearagas on the first and last form, which can otherwise give beastmaster parties trouble.

## Purobolos
* [Generic] 1500 HP, cast Exploder when low, will cast Life2 to revive other puroboloses when killed.
* [Generic] Easiest way to handle this is brute force with powerful AOEs to kill them all at once.
* [Break-Rods] Yup, that means rods.
* [NOT Break-Rods] Otherwise, whittle them down one-by-one to make them Explode; they won't Life2 when they do this.
* [Samurai] They're not heavy hahahaha you can just !Ianuki them repeatedly.
* [Beastmaster] Beastmasters have it super-easy here: they can just !Control the bombs and have them Exploder each other.
* [White-Mage] A Silenced Purobolos will not cast Life2 upon death.
* [Mystic-Knight] A Silence Bladed Purobolos will not cast Life2 upon death.
* [Bard] A Purobolos that's Stopped by !Sing will not cast Life2 upon death.

## Titan
* [Generic] 2500 HP; main threat is the Earth Shakers he casts for powerful (480-540) all-target damage.
* [Generic] He casts Earth Shaker on death, so you need to have a way to not wipe to that.
* [INTERSECTION White-Mage Red-Mate] WHM/RDM can cast Confuse on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float, which neatly evades Earth Shaker.
* [Chemist] Here's your introduction to the brokenness of !Mix: Antidote + Maiden's Kiss = Levisalve.
* [Beastmaster] Stopping Titan with !Calm right before you kill him will dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight.
* [Bard] Stopping Titan with !Sing right before you kill him will dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight.
* [Generic] Failing any way to scam Earth Shaker, the only real alternative is to have enough HP to survive it.

## Chimera
* [Generic] 3300 HP, not Heavy (laffo), alternates between (Fight or AquaRake) and (Blaze or AquaRake).
* [Generic] Basically any dirty trick will work on him, between his 0% M-evd, lack of Heavy, and status vulnerabilities.
* [Beastmaster] Bandersnatches from near Walse will cast Banish, which will 50/50 instant kill him.
* [Berserker] Death Sickles' doom proc will work on him. Berserker's a good class, I swear!
* [Blue-Mage] Blue Mages have so many ways to cheese this fight it's not even funny.
* [Samurai] Ianuki technically works on this guy, but how the hell did you master Samurai already?
* [Time-Mage] Time Mages can totally shut him down between Stop and Slow.
* [Bard] Bards can stoplock him easily.
