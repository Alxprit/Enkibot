WARNING: unexpected node transition adamantoise => soulcannon## Wing Raptor
* [Generic] "Cloud, attack while its tail is up!"
* [Blue-Mage] Don't forget to learn Goblin Punch, Aero, Vampire, and Flash.

## Post-Wind Shrine
* [Generic] Most classes will not need to purchase gear here to beat Karlabos, but it's cheap.
* [Beastmaster] If you plan on releasing it against the Antlion, don't open the trapped chest in the Training House.
* [Bard] There's a piano here, for parties with bards.

## karlabos
* [Generic] 650 HP; can inflict paralysis or lower a character to 1 HP. Basically the worst for solo games.
* [Generic] Just Potion up after getting hit by Tail Screw and you'll be fine.
* [Black-Mage] Black Mages can absolutely wreck him with Thunder, which he's weak to.
* [White-Mage] If you're stuck with four White Mages, you'll probably need to grind out another point of M at level 8.
* [Thief] Thief gets more points of M at levels 5 and 11. You may need to grind it out, or spend an inordinate amount of potions.

## Ship Graveyard
* [Generic] If you're feeling the pain w.r.t healing, the Calcruthls in here rarely drop Elixirs.
* [Generic] Don't forget, if you need to grind for any reason, you can sleep below decks on Faris' ship(wreck).
* [White-Mage] The enemies here are Undead, which makes this a great place to gain levels with your White Mages.
* [White-Mage] Make sure you pick up the hidden Flail; White Mage parties will rely on it for damage for a while.
* [Thief] The Daggers dropped by skeleton enemies here are a nice upgrade from Knives; get four before fighting Siren.

## Siren
* [Generic] 900 HP; switches between a high-MDEF human form and a high-PDEF undead form.
* [Generic] She has the heavy flag, so no getting cheeky with Phoenix Downs (which are expensive rn anyway)
* [NOT White-Mage] Even without !white, you can damage the undead form for 50 HP a shot with Potions.
* [White-Mage] You can use Cure to deal big damage to her undead form.
* [White-Mage] The Flail ignores defense, which means you can actually also do some pretty nice damage to her human form.
* [White-Mage] Remember that the Flail can be used from the back row at 100% damage.
* [Black-Mage] lol just nuke her with fire.
* [Blue-Mage] Don't try to use Vampire on her Undead form; the results are as predictable as they are unfortunate.
* [Monk] Fist criticals can penetrate Siren's hefty physical defense even in undead form.

## Kerwin/North Mountain
* [Generic] You don't care about it now, but unless you have Blue/Time, confused gaelicats on North Mountain are your only way to get Float.
* [Break-Rods] The hidden Frost Rod in Kerwin lets you trivialize either Magissa or Garula, so get it.
* [White-Mage] Pick up Armor/Protect in the Kerwin magic shop. Trust me on this one.
* [Bard] There's a piano here in Kerwin, too.
* [Knight] Optionally, get the heavy armor from the armor shop in Kewin; it's a nice upgrade.
* [Blue-Mage] If you restore their MP with Ether, you can learn Flash from the tombstone enemies in North Mountain.
* [Blue-Mage] I'm not actually sure it's worth it, frankly.

## Magissa + Forza
* [Generic] 650 HP; alternates between black magic and drain/fight. Summons Forza at 300 HP.
* [Generic] Forza has 850 HP and can easily one-shot a squishy character in the front row.
* [White-Mage] It's technically quite easy to sandbag your way through Magissa's 200 MP before she summons Forza, if you have !White.
* [Thief] Just bring a lot of potions if you have 4 thieves. There's no real way to finesse this fight.
* [Thief] If you're really in trouble, grind to level 16. With 4 Daggers, you can bring Magissa from 320 to dead in one set of !Fights.
* [Break-Rods] You can snap the Frost Rod from Kerwin here for dumb amounts of damage; pushing Magissa from 300-0 like that skips Forza.
* [Blue-Mage] Okay, this is like the one time in the game where Flash actually is really good: you can blind Forza easily.
* [Black-Mage] If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, you can also just Sleep Forza and unload on Magissa.

## Walse/Walse Tower
* [Knight] You can buy Iron armor in Walse town, which isn't strictly necessary since you can cheese Garula easily with your Knight.
* [Thief] Strongly consider the Kempo Gi armors from Walse town; you're gonna want every edge you can get for Garula.
* [Thief] Please, please, please steal four mythril daggers from the Y-Burns (sorry, wyverns) in Walse Tower.
* [Thief] Also, buy a fuckton of potions. Sorry, Garula just sucks for thieves.
* [Blue-Mage] In the waterfall behind Walse Castle, you can learn Frog Song. Not only is it very good vs. Garula, it's a generally nice spell to have.
* [Thief] Thieves have a fairly easy time getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle. It's nice vs. Garula.
* [NOT Thief] You probably don't want to bother with getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle, unless you're willing to abuse the Quicksave glitch in the GBA version.
* [Break-Rods] The RicardMages in Walse Tower can drop Flame Rods, if you snapped the free Frost Wand on Magissa and want to trivialize Garula.

## Garula
* [Generic] 1200 HP, begins countering every attack with Rush at 800 HP.
* [Generic] A definite trainwreck waiting to happen for unlucky and unprepared players.
* [Break-Rods] Of course, you could pretty much just toast him with one snapped rod farmed from a RicardMage downstairs.
* [Knight] Knights can cheese this fight hilariously with three critical-HP characters and one spamming Cover.
* [Knight] Garula can't do anything to you, it's hysterical.
* [Knight] Well, OK, he can still inflict HP Sap. Bring a few potions or something.
* [White-Mage] White Mages can cast Protect to make Garula's offense half as dangerous.
* [White-Mage] For 4x WHM parties: put everyone in the back row and ONLY attack with the Flail to minimize counterattacks.
* [White-Mage] It's easy enough to grind out. Also completely infuriating.
* [Thief] 4x Thief parties should have a mythril knife attacker in the front row and 3 potion chuckers in the back row.
* [Thief] Seriously expect to burn through 50-60+ potions if you're at a reasonable level and haven't been grinding.
* [Monk] The Monk's !Focus, which lets you hit twice as hard half as often, completely trivializes the counterattack mechanic.
* [Blue-Mage] You can get Frog Song to apply to Garula. He can cure himself, but he'll keep wasting turns.
* [Blue-Mage] Garula can't counterattack while frogged, either.
* [Blue-Mage] Blind will also stick to him, if for some reason frog abuse isn't enough.

## Tycoon (optional)
* [Generic] Check a world map to see how you can get back to Tycoon Castle early with the ship.
* [Generic] Treasure includes valuable healing items, such as multiple Elixirs.
* [Staff] You'll also get a Healing Staff, which casts Cura instead of attacking, and is totally amazing.
* [Samurai] You'll also get an Ashura katana, which is the first possible katana for samurai-havers.
* [NOT Samurai] You'll also get an Ashura katana, which may be useful if you're in Chaos and have a Freelancer.
* [Summoner] This is also a good time to head to the tower behind the waterfall in Walse to get Shiva.
* [Summoner] Worst case scenario, use a Fire Rod from Walse Tower (you did farm an extra, right?) or buy one in Karnak and come back.

## Fireship
* [Generic] You'll only get one discounted item at a Karnak store, so pick a pricey one.
* [Generic] Wild Nakks outside of Karnak are probably the easiest way to farm cash in world 1.
* [Break-Rods] This is especially nice since Karnak is the only source of rods in the world.
* [Break-Rods] Consider stocking up before going to the Fireship; rods make the Karnak 500 so much easier.
* [Bard] The third piano is also in Karnak, so make sure you get that for your bard.
* [Black-Mage] The magic store here sells level 3 black magic.
* [White-Mage] The magic store here sells Cura and Raise.
* [Time-Mage] The magic store here sells Stop and Gravity.
* [Generic] After some plot business, you'll be sent off to the next dungeon: the Fire Ship.
* [Blue-Mage] Crew Dusts in the Fire Ship cast Flash, which you can pick up for your Blue Mage.
* [INTERSECTION Thief Ninja] Thieves and Ninjas should make sure they get the Moonring Blade.
* [Thief] Thieves should also pick up the Thief's Gloves, which boost steal rate.

## Liquiflame
* [Generic] 3000 HP, transitions randomly between three forms when struck.
* [Generic] Human Form: single and multi target attacks and counters with target-all fire magic.
* [Generic] Hand Form: single target attacks that can paralyze and counters with Fire 2. IMMUNE TO MAGIC.
* [Generic] Tornado Form: casts Fire2 on self to heal.
* [Ranger] Consider killing it in Tornado Form to get the Fire Bow.
* [NOT Ranger] If you don't know whether you'll have ranger yet, consider killing it in Tornado Form to get the Fire Bow.
* [Break-Rods] Frost Rods will, of course, completely trash this guy. Do not use them when it's in hand form!
* [Monk] Fewer, bigger hits will do better against him, so !Focus ain't bad here.
* [Knight] The fewer times you have to hit liquidflame the fewer counters you see; consider using Two-Handed.
* [Mystic-Knight] Blizzara Sword up and just wreck this dude. Make sure you have a way to transform hand form, though.
* [Generic] Since the forms' MP is tracked seperately and the tornado cannot actually hurt you, consider just sitting there until it's out. It won't take long.
* [Berserker] Consider just having your Berserker blinded/dead as you enter the fight, until you run Tornado out of MP.

## The Karnak 500
* [Generic] You have a 5:00 to get as much loot out of the Karnak 500 as possible.
* [Generic] Have your jobs and abilities set immediately after you kill liquiflame; the Karnak 500 continues ticking in menu.
* [Generic] It's best to look up a map if this is your first time. There's a decent one on GameFAQs.
* [Knight] RUN RUN RUN run. No, the Brave Blade ain't worth it. Never take the Brave Blade.
* [Thief] If your offense is good, you can steal plenty of Elixirs from the Gigas enemies infesting this place.
* [Generic] Try and get the Elven Mantle and Main Gauche; those are the best unconditional loot in here.
* [Dancer] There's also a Ribbon! Get the Ribbon! You'll need it for your Dancer! It's rad!
* [NOT Dancer] You could let the Ribbon burn _i guess_ if you're an idiot retard fucker who deserves nothing except endless geomancers and red mages...
* [Blue-Mage] You can learn Aerora from the Gigases here for your Blue Mage, though it won't be too long until you can get it again.
* [Generic] You'll have to kill Iron Claw, a miniboss with 900 HP and some adds, before you exit the castle.
* [Blue-Mage] He can teach you Death Claw, and you'd be well advised to try and get it here. It's lovely against anything that's not Heavy.
* [Blue-Mage] Don't kill the sergeant before he transforms into Death Claw, if you do decide to do this.
* [NOT Blue-Mage] Don't bother fighting it out. You can prevent him from spawning simply by killing the two dogs, then punching the sergeant until he runs.
